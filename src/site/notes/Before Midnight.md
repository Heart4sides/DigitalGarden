You're mostly taking care of yourself
I'm taking care of myself and the others
I don't have the time to 
I have orbited my entire life around you
You take care of the world
Stop quizzing me. It's really fucking boring. 
Secret fear that the man would turn me into a submissive housewive
felt so ashamed to be so clueless
You did a good job faking it then
I was happy because they were happy 
Perpetually discontented : that's the human nature
The human state is multiple
That means you're depressed
I see beautiful energies of going forward in life or not letting anyone step on one
That's because you see anger as a positive emotion - you only end up hurting...
You like to have sex the exact same way every time
I'm a man of simple pleasures 
You're no Henry Miller on any level
This is all too planned
There' no room for spontaneity
I like hotel rooms. I think they're sexy. 
If you're looking for permission to disqualify me, I'm not gonna give it to you
