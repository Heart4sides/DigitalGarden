# Summary 
- It can grant you any wish but the cost will be way higher than the benefit (faustian deal, curse). 
- We tend to cage the demon, but that’s a bad strategy : if you tell someone to not do something, they’re going to do it. If you tell the demon to not go out, he’s going to go out.  
- We need to feed the demon from time to time, at the right time and place. 
- Sometimes, we need to come to a point where we have nothing to loose and everything to gain from let everything burn so new life can grow. 
- “He who is willing to save his life will lose it ; he who is willing it lose his life will gain it.” [[Jesus\|Jesus]]

# In Orbit 
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Orbit🔄\|💫]] with the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Infant😨]]
- Always adds adversity to the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Inferior]]. The question is whether the inferior will accept adversity or reject it ?

# In Reflection 
- With the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] 
- Reveals the Hero’s arrogance : 
	- By being arrogant itself : the demon believes it can do everything better than the other functions, because it is indeed the source of power and knowledge in the mind. It wants to destroy the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] as much as the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] wants to destroy the demon. 
	- By challenging the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Inferior]], showing the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] that it cannot always protect it and that the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Demon😈\|Demon😈]] is a necessary part of the inferior’s development.
