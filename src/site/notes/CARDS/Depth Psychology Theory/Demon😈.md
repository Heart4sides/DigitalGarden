# In Reflection 
- With the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] 
- Reveals the Hero’s arrogance : 
	- By being arrogant itself : the demon believes it can do everything better than the other functions, because it is indeed the source of power and knowledge in the mind. It wants to destroy the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] as much as the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] wants to destroy the demon. 
	- By challenging the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Inferior]], showing the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] that it cannot always protect it and that the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Demon😈\|Demon😈]] is a necessary part of the inferior’s development.
