# In Orbit 
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Orbit🔄\|💫]] with the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Nemesis😟\|Nemesis😟]].
- Immature : the nemesis covers its weakness to take the role of the inferior. But after making a lot of social faux-pas, the hero starts loosing faith in the nemesis and it starts worrying that the nemesis is unable to do its job, which causes the insecurity of the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Inferior]]. So the hero decides to do everything by itself.

# Reflection

- The [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Demon😈\|Demon😈]] reveals the Hero’s [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Arrogance\|Arrogance]] in the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Battleground of Titans\|Battleground of Titans]], for the demon is more powerful than the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] who acts like he can save the world on its own, but causes much collateral damage by doing so.
