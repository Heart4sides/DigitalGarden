# Prideful   
**Behaviour in a [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Immature🐇\|Immature🐇]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Ego🙋‍♂️\|Ego🙋‍♂️]]** 
- Looking for glory
- Starts very powerful but irresponsible, so it causes collateral damage wherever it goes 
- Doesn’t trust the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Nemesis😟\|Nemesis😟]] so it compensates by trying to do everything by itself so protect the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Inferior]], which makes it arrogant and narrow-minded.  
- Loops with the child, causing the latter to believe it can be a hero too 
---
# Humble   
**Behaviour in a [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Mature🐢\|Mature🐢]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Ego🙋‍♂️\|Ego🙋‍♂️]]** 
- Does its job which is to discover  
- Is responsible, does its job without pride or complaint

“Humility exists within us when we let go of our pride in the Hero. Or, as Chris Taylor said regarding his [Season 33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=2149s&ab_channel=C.S.Joseph) opening, “When the Hero lets go of being Heroic.” In fact, the Hero’s identification with being Heroic often makes it the *least* Heroic of all the functions.” `=this.Shortref`

# Complacent   
**Behaviour in a [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Immature🐇\|Immature🐇]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Sub🤸\|Subconscious🤸]]** 
- Rests on its laurels because “I’ve accomplished to much”, so stops working   
---
# Happy   
{ #bd964d}


**Behaviour in a [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Mature🐢\|Mature🐢]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Sub🤸\|Subconscious🤸]]** 
- Exchanges discovery for happiness
- Finds happiness in handing over the reigns to the infant. 
- Exchanges constant activity for rest - doesn’t try to constantly save the day, allow the other functions to grow

# In Axis   
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Axis↔️\|↔️]] with the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Infant😨]] 
---
# In Orbit   
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Orbit🔄\|💫]] with the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Nemesis😟\|Nemesis😟]].
- Immature : the nemesis covers its weakness to take the role of the inferior. But after making a lot of social faux-pas, the hero starts loosing faith in the nemesis and it starts worrying that the nemesis is unable to do its job, which causes the insecurity of the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Inferior]]. So the hero decides to do everything by itself.

# Reflection   
- The Hero is in orbit with the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Demon😈\|Demon😈]]. 
- The [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Demon😈\|Demon😈]] reveals the Hero’s [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Arrogance\|Arrogance]] in the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Battleground of Titans\|Battleground of Titans]], for the demon is more powerful than the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Hero🦸‍♂️\|Hero🦸‍♂️]] who acts like he can save the world on its own, but causes much collateral damage by doing so.
