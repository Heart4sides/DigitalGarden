# Wordnik Definition 
## egotism
*noun*: An inflated sense of one's own importance; conceit. <i>synonym</i>: <strong> conceit</strong>.
*noun*: The practice of putting forward or dwelling upon one's self; the habit of talking or writing too much about one's self.
*noun*: Hence An excessive esteem or consideration for one's self, leading one to judge of everything by its relation to one's own interests or importance.

### Synonyms 
- Pride, Egotism, Vanity, Conceit, Self-conceit, Self-consciousness. 
- *Pride* and *egotism* imply a certain indifference to the opinions of others concerning one's self.
- *Pride* is a self-contained satisfaction with the excellence of what one is or has, despising what others are or think. 
- *Vanity* is just the opposite; it is the love of being even fulsomely admired. <
- *Pride* rests often upon higher or intrinsic things: as, <em>pride</em> of family, place, or power; intellectual or spiritual pride.
- *Vanity* rests often upon lower and external things, as beauty, figure, dress, ornaments; but the essential difference is in the question of dependence upon others. Over the same things one person might have <em>pride</em> and another <em>vanity.</em> One may be too proud to be vain. 
- *Conceit*, or <em>self-conceit</em>, is an overestimate of one's own abilities or accomplishments: it is too much an elevation of the real self to rest upon wealth, dress, or other external things.
- *Egotism* is a strong and obtrusive confidence in one's self, shown primarily in conversation, not only by frequent references to self, but by monopolizing attention, ignoring the opinions of others, etc. It differs from <internalXref urlencoded="conceit">conceit</internalXref> chiefly in its selfishness and unconsciousness of its appearance in the eyes of others.
- *Conceit* becomes <em>egotism</em> when it is selfish enough to disparage others for its own comparative elevation. 
- Self-consciousness is often confounded with <em>egotism, conceit</em>, or <em>vanity</em>, but it may be only an embarrassing sense of one's own personality, an inability to refrain from thinking how one appears to others; it therefore often makes one shrink out of notice.
*noun*: Something which befalls you may seem a great misfortune;—you … begin to think that it is a chastisement, or a warning …. But give up this egotistic indulgence of your fancy; examine a little what misfortunes, greater a thousand fold, are happening, every second, to twenty times worthier persons; and your <em>self-consciousness</em> will change into pity and humility.
*noun*: The practice of too frequently using the word <ex>I</ex>; hence, a speaking or writing overmuch of one's self; self-exaltation; self-praise; the act or practice of magnifying one's self or parading one's own doings. The word is also used in the sense of <ex>egoism</ex>.
*noun*: A tendency to talk excessively about oneself.
*noun*: A belief that one is <xref>superior</xref> to or more important than others.
