# Definitions by CSJ
- I look to see the benefit to those behind the behavior to determine what retribution is available for me to use against those who wronged me or violated rules. I have to establish boundaries, so I don’t risk responding with rage once I justify my own contributing faults.
- Justification comes before the action. It is a reason to act, a motive 
- Provides justification based on who someone is 
- The orderly, rational, and moral expression of character.
