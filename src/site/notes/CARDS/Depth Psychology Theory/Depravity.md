## Wikipedia 
> Total **Depravity** (also called radical corruption or pervasive depravity) is a Protestant theological doctrine derived from the concept of original sin. It teaches that, as a consequence of man's fall, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin as a result of their fallen nature and, apart from the efficacious (irresistible) or prevenient (enabling) grace of God, is completely unable to choose by themselves to follow God, refrain from evil, or accept the gift of salvation as it is offered.
>
> The doctrine is advocated to various degrees by many Protestant denominations, including some Lutheran synods, and all Calvinist churches. Arminian denominations, such as Methodists, believe and teach total depravity, but with distinct differences, the most important of which is the distinction between irresistible grace and prevenient grace.
