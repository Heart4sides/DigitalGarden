- Envy is desiring what other people desire ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ne\|Ne]]) `=this.Shortref`
- Addictive covetousness over what is perceived as unfair (who deserves what)  
- A feeling of discontent or covetousness with regard to another's advantages, success, possessions, etc..  
- Envy comes from bitterness which comes from a lack of desire from other people  
- Envy is this thing that just burns within your soul constantly, like a smoldering flame and you can't get away from it.  
- It can also lead to Ni Nemesis despair like this, unlimited despair and depression that you just can't get away with. It forces them to overvalue personal safety or playing it safe instead of taking risks in life.  
- if I observe other people who may not actually be happier than me. But even if they just look happier than me, I burn with envy.  
- ISFJ & ENTP : we work the hardest. We have the best work ethic. We put in more effort than anyone else. Then envious of people who are happier with less efforts.  
- the expedient way is just to allow my envy to cause me to become this slothful person who is losing motivation.  
- It can also lead to, you know, ISFJs and ENTPs exacting revenge on other people, unfair justice on other people, or justice that goes too far, which is basically revenge.  
- the more envious I am, the harder I work, the more envious I am, the more effort I put into things. So it ends up becoming like this unlimited fire of motivation.  
- We want everything in life  
- ENTPs and ISFJs usually chase lives that they believe other people will be envious of.  
- Keeps us going regardless of our suffering, because we're always hoping for a better tomorrow.  
- Envy is an attempt to fill the hole of not being desired or feeling desirable.  
- We become very, very cold, which ends up causing people to not desire us because we're overly critical. And then that just leads to us being even more bitter. It also makes our envy get even worse, and it creates this downward spiral of envy in our life.  
- Sure, other people may not have deserved those things, but maybe those other people had someone else being compassionate to them for a reason.  
- Envy is usually a sign that the ENTP, ISFJ have oversimplified another person's life. Like, for example, they're not aware of what that other person lacks.  
- we want everything in life

And it's not like he can take what he had with him when he died because death was inevitable. He knew that, and that's why he wrote the book of Ecclesiastes just before he died. To actually share that level, high level of despair and that high level of, you know, he's basically in mourning, complaining about the vanity of life because it's like it's all worthless. Why did I work so hard? See what I'm saying? And that, too, is ultimately another aspect of despair when it comes to envy. Right?

they oftentimes can't really see passion because it's not really concrete. Sometimes passion can scare them off. They find passion to be cringe or creepy, as most people would say.

it is an act of [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Satisfaction\|satisfying]] fulfillment or gratification, the cause or means of being satisfied. So satisfaction is sought in the context of passion. Passion is drama, excitement,  
relationships and creativity. But it's also what drives you to live  
and what gives you fuel to press through adversity.

The Passion of the Christ was not a docile seeking of pleasure, but an expression of deeply held conviction to the point of absolute suffering. Passion can be shallow, but it is often the deepest motivation of a human being.

we want to be filled by other people's desire and desire for us. That's what we want. And oftentimes, this is one of the reasons why our seductive style is often the coquette, which is like this crazy cat and mouse game, etc.. Or the times we flip the script and we go full Rake.

And if someone is providing me a deep level of respect because it's got to be really deep because I'm deep, because like Extraverted Intuition  
Hero is like this gigantic dark ocean. Right? And they're this Ni, for example, INTJ being Ni Hero, burning with the fires of a thousand suns  
descending upon the dark ocean, turning the dark ocean into steam which leads to clouds which lead.¬†

And then the heat hits the clouds leads to electricity because the friction being caused and it causes lightning storms, it causes rain. And then rain falls down upon the earth and that creates life. Right? It literally is the water cycle. And that's what the Heart Temple is all about.

if someone has deep respect for us, that means they actually want us. `=this.Shortref` ^l6kan

That means they are burning with that fire of a thousand suns and they're creating life with us or we are doing life together.

A feeling of discontent or covetousness with regard to another's  
advantages, success, possessions, etc..


Keeps us going regardless of our suffering, because we're always hoping for a better tomorrow. Introverted intuition, the cognitive function attached to the heart  
temple is all about hope, right?

Envy is an attempt to fill the hole of not being desired or feeling desirable. Let me tell you something.

We oftentimes elect ourselves the judge of who deserves what on a constant basis.

You know, that's where the icey sword of truth comes from. We become very, very cold, which ends up causing people to not desire us because we're overly critical. And then that just leads to us being even more bitter. It also makes our envy get even worse, and it creates this downward spiral of envy in our life. And it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And then we, as a result, need to be grateful to those people instead of always sitting in a position of judgment on a regular basis, judging who deserves what. That's how we judge people. We always elect ourselves  
to judge in that area. And it's a terrible, terrible curse, a terrible, terrible behavior. And it really inhibits other people from getting compassion. I complain all the time.¬†

Like, even recently, I complain about how, like, you know, I rarely eat at my own table. I'm constantly being compassionate,¬† constantly Fe Child, and constantly giving to other people, but when's it my turn, right? And then all of a sudden, it's like, well, wait a minute, that's a covert contract. That's a covert contract on life. And I need to let  
go of that covert contract. It's wrong. It's also manipulative.

If I'm unsatisfied, it is my responsibility and nobody else's responsibility

if life really was fair, there'd be no room for love, there'd be no room for compassion. And even beyond that, there'd be no room for passion itself.¬†

The heart temple wouldn't exist, which means life wouldn't exist, which means life cannot exist in a fair world because a fair world only brings death. So the only thing fair about life is that it ends, is that it's death. Death is actually the ultimate equalizer. It is the ultimate fairness.

If we start electing ourselves  
the judge of who deserves what or what's fair, we're actually bringing death in people's lives. We're destroying their opportunities. We're actually taking away their future.

We can't do that. We're actually destroying other people's futures. We are destroying we taking away their choice. We are taking away their freedom. We are literally taking their lives away.

Malevolence through envy seeks to [[CARDS/¬∑ Related Concepts & Theories ¬∑/Balance\|Balance]] the scales of perceived injustice by reducing another's fortune to the same or below the level of one's own malevolence is a twisted version of a [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/CrusaderüèûÔ∏è‚öïÔ∏è\|CrusaderüèûÔ∏è‚öïÔ∏è]]'s Justice.

Ramsay Snow, who eventually becomes Ramsay Bolton because he's a bastard. Right?

And he basically cuts off the manhood of one of the other characters, a prince, actually, because he was envious of this prince and his life  
and how he had a dad, how he had a family. But he sees this prince  
completely squandering all of it and just using it for himself. So Ramsay punishes him with basically cutting off his dick.

That's how far malevolence goes when it comes to the deadly sin of envy, folks, because we are projecting our unsatisfaction on other people, such  
that we are holding those people responsible for the lack of satisfaction in our lives. When, at the end of the day, we just have to get to the point where we accept the truth.¬†

No one actually cares about us. No one. It's because that it's our responsibility to become satisfied. It's our responsibility to become better. It's our responsibility to build ourselves. It's our responsibility to work hard and, in effect, earn that satisfaction instead of just being envious of other people. We have to put in the effort.

Fanatic also means motivated or characterized by an extreme, uncritical enthusiasm or zeal as in religion or politics. Fanatical comes from the Latin word "fanaticus," which roughly translates to Inspired by God.¬†

ENTP, ISFJ can feel self glorified based on the object of their fanaticism. Envy expressed through fanaticism, seek satisfaction through fanatic loyalty to the object that is envied. So it's also like the quick, easy route. Remember what we're talking about? Do it as meaningful, not expedient. Well, it's expedient to punish other people through malevolence, but it's also expedient to put our faith into the wrong thing.

he was always talking about, you know, the Jews and the Jewish banksters and how they had all this thing. And he was so envious of them,  
so envious of their brotherhood, so envious of how they would give each other special treatment over everybody else.¬†

So what he did was like he's like, fine, I'm going to go find people like me who are who give me fanatical loyalty and I'm going to give them special treatment and they're going to give me special treat. And we're not going to give anyone else special treatment. And so the Nazi Party was created.

ENTPs, out of all the 16 types of the most likely to become cult leaders. So that criticism is actually valid. It's valid. Watch out, folks. Watch out. It all comes from the aspirational pole of fanaticism when attached to an ENTP's desire to reach satisfaction in life. That's where it comes from. [[CARDS/Individuals/Hitler\|Hitler]] did it.¬†

I mean, look at Malcolm X. He did the same thing. He was literally trying to convince African-Americans to leave their homes and all go up to the state of New Hampshire and take over in New Hampshire, have a black governor, black governor, black senators, black congressmen and women. An entire black society just for them and make it all about them because no one else is going to be about them.

fanaticism allows them to feel holier than the person they envy. It says I'm the better person because of what I believe. Wait, that's all of Mein Kampf when you actually read it. [[CARDS/Individuals/Hitler\|Hitler]] is literally saying I'm the better person because of what I believe.

There is a smug [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Satisfaction\|Satisfaction]] when one believes they are above the object or person that they envy. ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]]-[S7E28](https://offers.csjoseph.life/portal)) ^ad78ff

we just move from person to person to person or object of loyalty or teaching or author like a virus and just consume and move on, consume and move on, consumer and move on, consume and move on.

What is compassion? A feeling of deep sympathy or sorrow for another who is stricken by misfortune, accompanied  
by a strong desire to alleviate suffering.¬†

Do you guys know why [[CARDS/Individuals/Hitler\|Hitler]] started World War Two? Do you wanna know why? Because the Treaty of Versailles set the borders of Germany and Poland. And there was Germans who were living on the other side of the Polish border. The Polish rounded up all those Germans and started putting them in the concentration camps, starving them, forcing labor on them, raping them, killing them. [[CARDS/Individuals/Hitler\|Hitler]] was like, No, we're going to go rescue our countrymen.¬†

So it was an act of compassion that actually started World War Two.

Because that's what compassion really is. Intrinsically unfair treatment.

Envy is usually a sign that the ENTP, ISFJ have oversimplified another person's life. Like, for example, they're not aware of what that other person lacks.¬†

They see what that person has, but they're not paying enough attention  
to what that person lacks, which is something, for example, [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Templarüå†‚öïÔ∏è\|Templarüå†‚öïÔ∏è]] types, especially [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Lust\|Lust]] based [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Templarüå†‚öïÔ∏è\|Templarüå†‚öïÔ∏è]] types, with their with their pole of objectification, with their [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Lust\|Lust]] deadly sin. Like they really [[CARDS/¬∑ Related Concepts & Theories ¬∑/Understand\|Understand]]  what people lack because of Extraverted Sensing combined with their Extraverted Feeling, ESTPs and INFJs really know what other people lack more than anyone, and when they try to give what that person lacks to other people, it actually is a very special form of sympathy.

Compassion probes for the places of pain, suffering and dissatisfaction in other people's lives, and allows for understanding regarding the complexities of a person's trouble or successes. ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]]-[S7E28](https://offers.csjoseph.life/portal)) ^1a32b4

now we have the United States of America, literally because of Benjamin Franklin seeking [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Satisfaction\|Satisfaction]] in his life. Literally just because of that. So why does compassion always have to be soft and fluffy? Compassion can be quite literally bleeding with another person.¬†

It's taking part in other people's suffering. Compassion through malevolence is an attempt to bring a person closer to fulfillment  
by burning something extraneous away. This is the icy sword of truth. This is why ISFJs and ENTPs actually just tell the truth. They can be very blunt with people because they are, in effect, burning the lies away.¬†

We are the demons that torture other people, hoping that they realize that we're actually angels, trying to save them from their own ego investments, save them from the shackles that keep them down their life.

Compassion through fanaticism is an abundance of understanding. It basically glorifies compassion.¬†

Compassion through fanaticism often represses whatever envious or malevolent tendencies they may have. Compassion through fanaticism runs the risk of losing touch with oneself. Too much envy can be destructive, but too much compassion can make you a doormat.¬†

This is why, like, for example, while I'm being sexually abused by my cousins, growing up, oftentimes I would be the one who would facilitate the abuse. I became addicted to the abuse, and I would seek them out and ask them to abuse me and set up situations where they could abuse me like I was their fanatic, loyal, little follower.

I finally stood up for myself and had self-respect at age 14 and I stopped my ESTP cousin from abusing me.

Luckily, I called her out for it and she admitted it and took responsibility in front of the family, which was good. And and I have forgiven her and we've all moved on. And I don't have a problem with her  
anymore. It's pretty cool. Pretty cool that she was able to do that. Her ISFP sister, however, completely denies it to this day. So it is what it is.

Compassion through fanaticism focuses entirely on the other person creating a fanatical religion of external care. But it is often a covert contract for the ENTP, ISFJ to secretly get what they want through their repressed envy.

## Wikipedia 
> **Envy** is an emotion which occurs when a person lacks another's quality, skill, achievement, or possession and either desires it or wishes that the other lacked it.Aristotle defined envy as pain at the sight of another's good fortune, stirred by "those who have what we ought to have". Bertrand Russell said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness. Recent research considered the conditions under which it occurs, how people deal with it, and whether it can inspire people to emulate those they envy.
