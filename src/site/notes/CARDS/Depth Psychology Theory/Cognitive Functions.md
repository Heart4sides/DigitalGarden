The 8 Cognitive Functions are 8 different ways of interacting with the world. 
Everyone uses all 8 functions, but in different orders of preference, that are tied to [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/AttitudeðŸŽ­\|attitudes]]. 

# 8 cognitive Functions 
- 4 functions for gathering information ([[SOURCES/Type Theory by CSJ/Mechanics/Perception\|Perception]])
	- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ne\|Ne]] ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ne\|Extroverted Intuition]]) : Possibilities
	- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ni\|Ni]] ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ni\|Introverted Intuition]]) : Desire
	- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Se\|Se]] ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Se\|Extroverted Sensation]]) : Physics 
	- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Si\|Si]] : ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Si\|Introverted Sensation]]) : Experience
[[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Wheel of Perception\|Wheel of Perception]] :
```mermaid

graph LR; 

Ne --> Ni --> Se --> Si --> Ne

```
- 4 functions for making decisions ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Judgement\|Judgement]])
	- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Te\|Te]] ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Te\|Extroverted Thinking]]) : [[CARDS/Â· Related Concepts & Theories Â·/Belief\|Belief]] 
	- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ti\|Ti]] ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ti\|Introverted Thinking]]) : Deduction 
	- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fe\|Fe]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fe\|(Extroverted Feeling]]) : Ethics
	- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|(Introverted Feeling]]) : Morals 
[[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Wheel of Judgement\|Wheel of Judgement]] :
```mermaid

graph LR; 

Te --> Ti --> Fe --> Fi --> Te

```

# Hierarchy 
Like with our hands, some functions are prefered over others, such that we are more at ease with using them.  
> Example : some prefer to judge wether something is true or false, while others prefer to judge whether something is right or wrong. 

These preferences exclude each other ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Reflection ðŸªž\|Reflection ðŸªž]]): 
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ti\|Ti]] (*Deduce*) excludes [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi]] (*Weigh*) : to judge wether sth is true / false ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ti\|Ti]]) one must restrain oneself to judge whether it is good / bad ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi]])
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Si\|Si]] (*Sense*) excludes [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ni\|Ni]] (*Imagine*) 
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Se\|Se]] (*React*) excludes [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ne\|Ne]] (*Predict*)
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Te\|Te]] (*Believe*) excludes [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fe\|Fe]] (*Empathize*)
