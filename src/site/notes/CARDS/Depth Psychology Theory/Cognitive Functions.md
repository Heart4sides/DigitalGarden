Cognitive Functions are mental tools to be used and improved to deal with life and other humans. 
Like with our hands, some functions are prefered over others, such that we are more at ease with some functions than others. 

Example : some prefer to judge wether something is true or false, while others prefer to judge whether something is right or wrong. 
These preferences exclude each other :
