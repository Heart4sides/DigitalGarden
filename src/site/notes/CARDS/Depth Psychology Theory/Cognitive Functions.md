Cognitive Functions are mental tools to be used and improved to deal with life and other humans. 
Like with our hands, some functions are prefered over others, such that we are more at ease with some functions than others. 

Example : some prefer to judge wether something is true or false, while others prefer to judge whether something is right or wrong. 
These preferences exclude each other : 
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ti游디勇끂|Ti游디勇끃] (*Deduce*) excludes [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fi游댬\|Fi游댬]] (*Weigh*) : to judge wether sth is true / false ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ti游디勇끂|Ti游디勇끃]) one must retrain itself to judge whether it is good / bad ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fi游댬\|Fi游댬]])
