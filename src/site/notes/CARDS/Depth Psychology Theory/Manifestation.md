- Initiative expressed through manifestation is creating an aura of authority through concrete action. [‚Ä¶] They manifest authority through gathering valuable life experience, by taking the initiative to gain new experiences for themselves and get outside of their comfort zone.

## Video : Deadly Sin of Sloth

- Habitual disinclination to exertion. Laziness. Indolence.  
- So what is sloth? Quote, habitual disinclination to exertion. Laziness. Indolence. So no two types are worse at resting on their laurels than ESTJs and INFPs, obviously. 
- Sloth is ultimately entitled to authority : ‚ÄúHey, I've worked really hard. I've put all this effort. I have these credentials. You have to respect me, (with their Te), right? You have to give me that regard because I'm the rule maker now. I've been following the rules my whole life, and now I'm going to make you follow the rules because I have.‚Äù ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]] ) ^wrbjv
- Intense self-satisfaction with one's own efforts or accomplishments leading to laziness, close-mindedness and intellectuel stagnation. entitlement to feeling that you already know enough and should be treated as an expert. at some point the king must be sitting on his throne and stop conquering other lands.  
- They are too lazy to [[CARDS/¬∑ Related Concepts & Theories ¬∑/Understand\|Understand]] that different types need different tools and to implement systems that don't work only for them. so they only pay attention to the tools that matter to them and expect everyone to be like them.  
- Slothful when they fear to loose their power, so they freeze themselves in time instead of putting their power at risk to gain more. Then their power slowly decays.  
- Sloth is ultimately entitled to authority. It's because like, it's like, Hey, I've worked really hard. I've put all this effort. I have these credentials. You have to respect me  
- This is oftentimes why ESTJs and INFPs in the workplace ultimately end up being replaced because they get too comfortable in their position of power and authority. 

## Sloth through Credulity 

- Credulity is defined by willingness to believe or trust too readily. Especially without proper or adequate evidence. 
- Gullibility. 
- So, sloth through credulity is another way that the ESTJ and the INFP rest on their laurels. Quote "If this is accepted in certain circles, I am to assume it's true". ESTJs and INFPs who don't verify are the worst educators and the most ineffective authorities. Basically 
- Sloth through credulity is a covert contract to obtain authority: "If I accept what is thought to be true by others, especially certain, more valuable circles of people, then they will elevate me to authority." ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]] ) ^d0g2t
- At best. You, as in the ESTJ and INFP will be ineffective. At worst. more likely it'll be a faustian deal and you'll be a slave to higher authorities

## Sloth through Manifestation 

- Manifestation expressed through Sloth is the age old attempt to get something for nothing. Fake it until you make it. ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]] , S7E22) ^8f2ek
- It works. It is actually a valid strategy. It does work. The thing is, though, is that when people finally actually realize that you're being fake, guess what? You going to be tarred and feathered. You're going to be punished. You're going to be owned.


## Pope Gregory "Moralia in Job"

- "From melancholy there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, despair, slothfulness in fulfilling the commands, and a wandering of the mind on unlawful objects.'  
- "Melancholy is also wont to exhort the conquered heart as if with reason, when it says, What ground hast thou to rejoice, when thou endurest so many wrongs from thy neighbour? Consider with what sorrow all must be looked upon, who are turned in such gall of bitterness against thee."
