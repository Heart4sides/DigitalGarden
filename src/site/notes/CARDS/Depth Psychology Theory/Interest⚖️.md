- [interest | Etymology, origin and meaning of interest by etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/interest?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_9399)
	- mid-15c., "legal claim or right; a concern; a benefit, advantage, a being concerned or affected (advantageously)," from Old French interest "damage, loss, harm" (Modern French intérêt), from noun use of Latin interest "it is of importance, it makes a difference," third person singular present of interresse "to concern, make a difference, be of importance," literally "to be between," from inter "between" (see [inter-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/inter-?ref=etymonline_crossreference "Etymology, meaning and definition of inter- ")) + esse "to be" (from PIE root [*es-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*es-?ref=etymonline_crossreference "Etymology, meaning and definition of *es- ") "to be"). The sense development to "profit, advantage" in French and English is not entirely clear.
