(See list under <internalXref urlencoded="indifference">indifference</internalXref>.) <em>Indifference</em> denotes absence of feeling, passion, or desire toward a particular object: as, <em>indifference</em> to pain or ridicule. <em>Apathy</em> commonly implies a general want of feeling, a complete indifference in regard to anything, due to want of interest or attention, as in the case of a repressed or sluggish intellect, or of extreme illness or affliction. <em>Insensibility</em> and <em>impassibility</em> suggest the lack of capacity for feeling, or an absence of susceptibility, being qualities rather than states of mind. <em>Indifference</em> arising from <internalXref urlencoded="impassibility">impassibility</internalXref> relates more particularly to internal, that arising from <internalXref urlencoded="insensibility">insensibility</internalXref> to external, impressions; the former is, moreover, more profound and radical than the latter. <em>Indifference</em> may be an entirely proper state under the circumstances; <em>insensibility</em> and <em>impassibility</em> are always at least to be pitied; <em>unconcern</em> is always and <em>indifference</em> sometimes blameworthy, as cold and selfish. <em>Stoicism</em> is a studied suppression of feeling, or the concealment especially of painful feeling by force of will. <em>Unconcern</em> is absence of solicitude. (See <internalXref urlencoded="care">care</internalXref>.) <em>Phlegm</em> most suggestive of physical temperament; it is a constitutional dullness or sluggishness, an incapability of being aroused by anything. <em>Calmness</em> is a tranquillity resulting from the mastery of the will over passions and feelings that perhaps are strong and keen, and hence is always commendable.
*noun*: In the <em>Stoic philos.</em>, a certain imperturbability produced in the wise man's soul by sincere rejection of the notion that pleasure is in itself desirable, or pain in itself undesirable and by trained watchfulness to exclude all unreasonable passions (all passions affecting conduct being regarded as unreasonable).
*noun*: Want of feeling; privation of passion, emotion, or excitement; dispassion; -- applied either to the body or the mind. As applied to the mind, it is a calmness, indolence, or state of indifference, incapable of being ruffled or roused to active interest or exertion by pleasure, pain, or passion.

## Wikipedia
> **Apathy** is a lack of feeling, emotion, interest, or concern about something. It is a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as concern, excitement, motivation, or passion. An apathetic individual has an absence of interest in or concern about emotional, social, spiritual, philosophical, virtual, or physical life and the world. Apathy can also be defined as a person's lack of goal orientation. Apathy falls in the less extreme spectrum of diminished motivation, with abulia in the middle and akinetic mutism being more extreme than both apathy and abulia.The apathetic may lack a sense of purpose, worth, or meaning in their life. People with severe apathy tend to have a lower quality of life and are at a higher risk for mortality and early institutionalization. They may also exhibit insensibility or sluggishness. In positive psychology, apathy is described as a result of the individuals' feeling they do not possess the level of skill required to confront a challenge (i.e. "flow"). It may also be a result of perceiving no challenge at all (e.g. the challenge is irrelevant to them, or conversely, they have learned helplessness). Apathy is something that all people face in some capacity and is a natural response to disappointment, dejection, and stress. As a response, apathy is a way to forget about these negative feelings. This type of common apathy is usually felt only in the short term, but sometimes it becomes a long-term or even lifelong state, often leading to deeper social and psychological issues. An extreme form of apathy may be someone being numb to different stressful life events such as losing a job.

> Apathy should be distinguished from reduced affect display, which refers to reduced emotional expression but not necessarily reduced emotion.

> Pathological apathy, characterized by extreme forms of apathy, is now known to occur in many different brain disorders, including neurodegenerative conditions often associated with dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Although many patients with pathological apathy also have depression, several studies have shown that the two syndromes are dissociable: apathy can occur independently of depression and vice versa.
