- Sloth is ultimately entitled to authority : “Hey, I've worked really hard. I've put all this effort. I have these credentials. You have to respect me, (with their Te), right? You have to give me that regard because I'm the rule maker now. I've been following the rules my whole life, and now I'm going to make you follow the rules because I have.” ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]] )
