# Personal Observations 
- Sloth is caused by a lack of [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ni\|desire]], which comes from the individual’s [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Heart Temple🎭\|Heart Temple🎭]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Superego👹\|Superego👹]] 
- The effect of this focus is a lack of [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/action\|action]], which comes from the individual’s [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Body Temple 🌳\|Body Temple 🌳]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Shadow👤\|Shadow👤]] 
- It creates the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/UD👤⬅️\|UD👤⬅️]] pole of [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Manifestation\|Manifestation]], which “attempts to get something for nothing” ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]], S7E22). 
- [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Manifestation\|Manifestation]] is “the indication of the existence of something” ([Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/words/manifestation)), but through sloth, it indicates the presence of something that isn’t there.

# Definition by CSJ 

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Sloth is ultimately entitled to authority : “Hey, I've worked really hard. I've put all this effort. I have these credentials. You have to respect me, (with their Te), right? You have to give me that regard because I'm the rule maker now. I've been following the rules my whole life, and now I'm going to make you follow the rules because I have.” ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]] )

- Basically sloth through credulity is a covert contract to obtain authority.  : "If I accept what is thought to be true by others, especially certain, more valuable circles of people, then they will elevate me to authority." ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]], S7E22)

“Idleness, inactivty, laxness, slothfulness, indolence, lazyness; avoid them with a strong and energetic desire to [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/get things done\|get things done]]. Sloth is a sin as not having this energetic desire for everything that has been created for you, means you do not wish for it.” `=this.Shortref`
