# Companion Guide 
[Type Grid Companion Guide Download | C.S. Joseph](https://csjoseph.life/type-grid-companion-guide-download/)

- “Prefers to ask forgiveness instead of permission.” 
- “If you want something done right, do it yourself.”

## Watch what people do : 
- Pragmatic : What Gets Results
- Affiliative : What is the Good or Proper Thing

Affiliative is focus on the proper, what “should” be, or “what’s right” based
on group [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Standard\|standards]]. In contrast, Pragmatic is focus on individualism,
effectiveness, and “what works” with less regard for [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Standard\|standards]] or rules. 
[[SOURCES/Type Theory by CSJ/Type Grid/Temperament/Affiliative (by CSJ)\|Affiliative (by CSJ)]] values cooperation within a family, group, or team; Pragmatic
values independence and self-determination. Affiliative respects authority
and proven methodologies. Pragmatic challenges authority and seeks new
ways of doing things. Affiliative seeks permission before acting and is
apologetic. Pragmatic seeks forgiveness after acting without permission.

-   independance and freedom
-   Others : obstacles in the way of their desired results. 
-   Task focused. 
-   Pragmatic types instead focus on what works and value self-determination. 
-   The Pragmatic individual seeks the fastest or most optimal outcome. 
-   Because of these characteristics, Pragmatic types act first then ask forgiveness.

-   “ I need to pick my own role so I work where I’m most effective.”
-   “ Self-sufficiency is the key to self respect.”
-   “ A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.”
