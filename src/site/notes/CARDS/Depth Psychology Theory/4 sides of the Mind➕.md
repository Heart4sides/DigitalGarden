# 1. Ego 🙋‍♂️
- Our Type = Our [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Ego🙋‍♂️\|Ego🙋‍♂️]] = Our 4 preferred [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Cognitive Functions\|Cognitive Functions]] in a specific order. 
- We spend around 75% of our time in our [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Ego🙋‍♂️\|Ego🙋‍♂️]].  But events in our lives push us to momentarily modify this order of preference by transitioning into one of the other 3 sides of our mind. 

> ***Example** : the ISTJ type prefers using these 4 functions : 
		1. Si = my experience 
		2. Te = others’ thoughts 
		3. Fi = my moral values 
		4. Ne = others’ desires*

# 2. Subconscious 🤸
- When we are forced or allowed to express the **weakest** function of our [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Ego🙋‍♂️\|Ego🙋‍♂️]] = the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Infant😨]]
- We transition into the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Sub🤸\|Subconscious🤸]] , where our natural order of preference gets turned upside down. 
- The weak becomes the strong and the strong becomes the weak.
- Provided that we overcome - with courage or faith - the **fearful** attitude of the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Infant😨\|Infant😨]], we will experience **[[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Happiness\|Happiness]]**.  

> ***Example** : An IxTP, naturally focused on what is true or false ([[Ti)\|Ti)]], will prefer to care for other people’s values and to act ethically ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fe\|Fe]]) when transitioning into his [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Sub🤸\|Subconscious🤸]].*

# 3. Shadow 👤
- When we are forced or allowed to express the repressed functions of our mind (our [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Secund\|secundary]] preferences), we transition into the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Shadow👥\|Shadow👥]], where we experience the other side of the coin.
- This side is naturally pessimistic and source of suffering in our lives. Only adversity can push us towards this side of the mind.  
- Provided that we can overcome our [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Worry\|worry]] and antagonistic attitude towards the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Nemesis😟\|Nemesis😟]] , we will get [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Wisdom\|wisdom]] out of this transition. 

> ***Example** : An ISxJ, naturally focused on his own experience ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Si\|Si]]), will perceive the experiences of others ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Se\|Se]]) when he transitions into his [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Shadow👥\|Shadow👥]].*

# 4. Superego 👹
- When we are forced or allowed to express the least valued functions of our mind ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Trickster🤡\|Trickster🤡]] & [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Demon😈\|Demon😈]]), we transition into the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Superego👹\|Superego👹]], where we experience revelation about ourself.
- Provided that we can overcome our apathy towards the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Demon😈\|Demon😈]], we will experience [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Love\|Love]] as the highest level of understanding for the alterity in ourselves and others. 

> ***Example** : An ExTJ, naturally protective of their own sense of value ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi]]) at the detriment of others, will experience other’s values ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fe\|Fe]]) when he transitions into his [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Superego👹\|Superego👹]].*
