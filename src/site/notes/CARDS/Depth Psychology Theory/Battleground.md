"The secret of extracting meaning from the Battlegrounds, however, as revealed by Chris Taylor, is not about victory or defeat. **Rather, it is about using the conflict that the Reflector functions create to become aware of them and give each Reflector function in each Battleground the space to express itself.** The reason there is a “battle” on the Battlegrounds, to begin with, is because we ignore half of the Reflector functions. If we want to develop, we need access to all of them. "
