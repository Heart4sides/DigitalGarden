> - “**Information** is the meaning of these sensory stimuli (_i.e._, the empirical perception). For example, the noises that I hear are data. _The meaning of these noises_ (_e.g._, a running car engine) _is information_. Still, there is another alternative as to how to define these two concepts—which seems even better. Data are sense stimuli, or their meaning (_i.e._, the empirical perception). Accordingly, in the example above, the loud noises, _as well as the perception of a running car engine_, are data. (Italics added. Bold in original.)”

“Cleveland described wisdom simply as "integrated knowledge—information made super-useful".[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#cite_note-Wallace-9)[14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#cite_note-Cleveland-14) Other authors have characterized wisdom as "knowing the right things to do"[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#cite_note-Chisholm-6) and "the ability to make sound judgments and decisions apparently without thought".[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#cite_note-Wallace-9)[28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#cite_note-Gamble-28) Wisdom involves using knowledge for the greater good. Because of this, wisdom is deeper and more uniquely human. It requires a sense of good and bad, right and wrong, ethical and unethical.”
