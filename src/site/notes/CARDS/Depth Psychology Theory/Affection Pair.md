Relationship of affection

## Benefit : joy 

Best pair for people who lack joy in their life

Joy (dictionary.com) :
- the emotion of great delight or happiness caused by something exceptionally good or [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Satisfaction\|satisfying]]; keen pleasure; elation:She felt the joy of seeing her son's success.
- a source or cause of keen pleasure or delight; something or someone greatly valued or appreciated:Her prose style is a pure joy.
- the expression or display of glad feeling; festive gaiety.
- a state of happiness or felicity.


## Relationship of reconciliation 

Chances of breakup and reconciliations are the highest. Once reconciliated, chances are you won't ever break up again. It's the test of the demons. 
Highest highs lowest lows. 
If both have the same octogram the breakup is far less likely. 
The inferior function will test the insecurity of the other inferior function. That's when the breakup can happen. 

## Octogram 

UD/UF should be with UD/UF in golden relationships so they don't compete for the same cognitive origin. 

## Statistics

### Other Notes
