[C.S. Joseph Member's Area](https://offers.csjoseph.life/portal) - “Softlocking” 

- "Keeping you in a side of your mind in a consistant basis"[^2]
- Someone blocks you in a side of your mind when they're around you[^2]
- Behavior developed through "managing judgements and expectations"[^1]
{ #8aeee5}

- You softlock your child in a part of their mind where they are compatible with you on the optimistic-pessimistic axis. Ex : Fe parent - Fi superego parent[^1]
