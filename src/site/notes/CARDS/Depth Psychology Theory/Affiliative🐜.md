## Watch what people do : 
- Pragmatic : What Gets Results
- Affiliative : What is the Good or Proper Thing

Affiliative is focus on the proper, what “should” be, or “what’s right” based on group [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Standard\|standards]]. In contrast, Pragmatic is focus on individualism, effectiveness, and “what works” with less regard for standards or rules.
Affiliative values cooperation within a family, group, or team; Pragmatic
values independence and self-determination. Affiliative respects authority and proven methodologies. Pragmatic challenges authority and seeks new ways of doing things. Affiliative seeks permission before acting and is apologetic. Pragmatic seeks forgiveness after acting without permission.

-   Being supportive is an affiliative behavior 
-   What's right 
-   interdependance

# Notes 

- Fe is social action justified by [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ti🗡️\|Ti🗡️]] truth. 
- Fi judges if the social norm can become a law of his life : is there a value to this norm ? 
- Fe = seeks gratitude
- Fi = seeks credit 
- Fe = avoidant (about other's worth)
- Fi = anxious (about own's worth)
- I feel sad for this person, because I can see what they are going through and I know what it's like? = Fi
- I feel what you feel even when I may not understand sh*t about what's going on with you (potentially up to the point of being confused whether the emotion is your own or theirs)? = Fe 
- affiliatives like to play race, gender, etc cards involving their behavior
