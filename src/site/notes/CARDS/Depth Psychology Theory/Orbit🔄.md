## Definitions by C.S. Joseph
- "Orbit is when what affects one function affects the other" ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CSJ]]· [S18 1st Orbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3msCUQJGFc&t=1234s&pp=ygUJY3NqIG9yYml0) )
- Transfer of information, stream of [[communication\|communication]] between the introverted and the extraverted variant of a function (ex: between Ne and Ni)
- Two way street, with one unconscious door (Backdoor)
- DC = direct current 
- [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Compensate\|compensation]]
- [[SOURCES/Type Theory by CSJ/Mechanics/Synchronicity\|Synchronicity]] = orbit between two psyches.

## Wikipedia

> In celestial mechanics, an **Orbit** is the ==curved== trajectory of an object such as the trajectory of a planet around a star, or of a natural satellite around a planet, or of an artificial satellite around an object or position in space such as a planet, moon, asteroid, or Lagrange point. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the center of mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
>
> For most situations, orbital motion is adequately approximated by Newtonian mechanics, which explains gravity as a force obeying an inverse-square law. However, Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetime, with orbits following geodesics, provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion.
