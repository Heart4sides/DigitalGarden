# Pope Gregory "Moralia in Job"
- "From gluttony are propagated foolish mirth, scurrility, uncleanness, babbling, dulness of sense in understanding."  
- "Gluttony is also wont to exhort the conquered heart, as if with reason, when it says, God has created all things clean, in order to be eaten, and he who refuses to fill himself with food, what else does he do but gainsay the gift that has been granted him. "
