# Daily Prayer in the Home for the Dying 

“Dearest Lord, may I see you today and every day in the person of your sick, and while nursing them, minister to you.

Though you hide yourself behind the unattractive disguise of the irritable ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi]]), the [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/exacting\|exacting]], the unreasonable (lacking [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Te\|Te🏹]]), may I still recognize you, and say:

“Jesus, my patient, how sweet it is to serve you.”

Lord, give me this seeing [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Faith\|Faith]]([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Si\|Si⛰️]]), then my work will never be [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/monotonous\|monotonous]]. I will ever find joy ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/SF🤸➡️\|SF🤸➡️]]) in humoring the fancies and gratifying the wishes ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ne\|Ne💧]]) of all poor sufferers.

O beloved sick, how doubly dear ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi🧭]]) you are to me, when you personify Christ; and what a privilege ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi🧭]]) is mine to be allowed to tend you.

Sweetest Lord, make me [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/appreciate\|appreciative]] ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi🧭]]) of the [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/dignity\|dignity]] of my high vocation, and its many responsibilities. Never permit me to disgrace it by giving way to [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/coldness\|coldness]], unkindness, or impatience.

And O God, while you are Jesus, my patient, deign also to be to me a patient Jesus, bearing with my faults ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fe\|Fe💉]]), looking only to my intention, which is to love and serve you in the person of each of your sick.

Lord, increase my faith, bless my efforts and work, now and for evermore. Amen.“
