- Bene Gesserit : **The Voice:** "Ability to influence people directly by giving them orders with a certain sound frequency. When a person is ordered to do something by the use of Voice it is almost impossible not to comply. A Bene Gesserit is trained to resist the Voice. The downside of it is the phenomenon of the entire population becoming immune to it if The Voice is being overly used upon a population. Mentats can especially become immune to the Voice if he understands how it works."
