For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like “there are biological differences

20:48

between men and women,” which is obviously true.

20:51

But he’ll say it the context of a conversation about the underrepresentation of women in government,

20:56

which implies what exactly?

20:59

So how do you respond to this?

21:01

Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing against the obviously true statement, or you

21:05

have to guess at what he’s implying, in response to which he can accuse you of misrepresenting

21:10

him, which is exactly what happened with the Cathy Newman interview.
