[Marcus Aurelius didn't like people. | By Daily Stoic](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=saved&v=172503052358068)

- “The things ([[CARDS/Typing Toolbox/-Te🏹\|-Te🏹]]) you think about ([[CARDS/Typing Toolbox/-Ti🗡️\|-Ti🗡️]]) determine the quality ([[CARDS/Typing Toolbox/-Fi🧭\|-Fi🧭]]) of your mind. Your [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Soul Temple👤\|Soul👤]] takes on the color of your thoughts."
- "The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength."
