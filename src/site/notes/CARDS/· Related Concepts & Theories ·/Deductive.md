[_Deductive_](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/deductive) reasoning (also called _[deduction](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/deduction)_) involves starting from a set of general premises and then drawing a specific conclusion that contains no more information than the premises themselves. _Deductive_ reasoning is sometimes called _deduction_ (note that _deduction_ has other meanings in the contexts of mathematics and accounting).

Here’s an example of _deductive_ reasoning: chickens are birds; all birds lay eggs; therefore, chickens lay eggs. Another way to think of it: if something is true of a general class (birds), then it is true of the members of the class (chickens).

_Deductive_ reasoning can go wrong, of course, when you start with incorrect premises. For example, look where this first incorrect statement leads us: all animals that lay eggs are birds; snakes lay eggs; therefore, snakes are birds.

The scientific method can be described as _deductive_. You first formulate a [hypothesis](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hypothesis)—an educated guess based on general premises (sometimes formed by inductive methods). Then you test the hypothesis with an [[[Experimentation\|experiment]]](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/experiment). Based on the results of the experiment, you can make a specific conclusion as to the accuracy of your hypothesis.

_Deductive_ reasoning is popularly associated with detectives and solving mysteries. Most famously, [Sherlock Holmes](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/holmes) claimed to be among the world’s foremost practitioners of _deduction_, using it to solve how crimes had been committed (or impress people by guessing where they had been earlier in the day).

However, despite this association, reasoning that’s referred to as _deduction_ in many stories is actually more like _induction_ or a form of reasoning known as _[abduction](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/abduction)_, in which probable but uncertain conclusions are drawn based on known information.

Sherlock’s (and [Arthur Conan Doyle](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/conan-doyle)’s) use of the word _deduction_ can instead be interpreted as a way (albeit imprecise) of referring to systematic reasoning in general.

Example : 
**Premises:** I am lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerant people get sick when they consume dairy. This milkshake contains dairy.  
**Conclusion:** I will get sick if I drink this milkshake.
