- Too much of it leads to stagnation, as the return on investment diminishes with time.

‚ÄùThe man of superior virtue is not conscious of his virtue,  
And in this way he really possesses virtue.  
The man of inferior virtue never loses sight of his virtue,  
And in this way he loses his virtue.‚Äù (Lao Tzu, Tao-te Ching ch. 38)
