### Synonyms 
Obstinate, Stubborn, Intractable, Refractory, Contumacious, pertinacious, headstrong, unyielding, dogged, wilful, persistent, immovable, inflexible, firm, resolute. 

The first five words now imply a strong and vicious or disobedient refusal to yield, a resolute or unmanageable standing upon one's own [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ni\|will]]. 
- <em>Stubborn</em> is strictly negative: a <em>stubborn</em> child will not [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Te\|listen]] to advice or commands, but perhaps has no definite purpose of his own. 
- <em>Obstinate</em> is active: the <em>obstinate</em> man will carry out his intention in spite of advice, remonstrance, appeals, or force. The last three of the italicized words imply disobedience to proper authority. 
- <em>Intractable</em>, literally not to be drawn, handled, or governed, is negative; so is <em>refractory</em>: both suggest sullenness or perverseness; <em>refractory</em> is more appropriate where resistance is physical: hence the extension of the word to apply to metals. 
- <em>Contumacious</em> combines pride, haughtiness, or insolence with disobedience; in law it means wilfully disobedient to the orders of a court.
