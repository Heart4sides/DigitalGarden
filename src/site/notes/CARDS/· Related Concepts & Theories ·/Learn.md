# Attitudes 
- Target the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Criticü§î\|Criticü§î]] to [[CARDS/¬∑ Related Concepts & Theories ¬∑/Teach\|teach]] someone a lesson. People listen when you call them out on their [[Hypocricy\|Hypocricy]], even if they don‚Äôt seem to.

- The [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Childüëº\|Childüëº]] must learn to explore the unknown with the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Tricksterü§°\|Tricksterü§°]]. 

# Functions 

Learning from : 
- Your own [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Quadra\|Quadra]] : fastest way to grow, but most painful. Challenges your ego investments. 
- Your [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Golden Quadra\|Golden Quadra]] : teaches you in a way that protects your ego investments, so learning is slower.

If you see what other people are doing (Se) you're also gaining personal experience (Si). 
That's kinesthetic [[CARDS/¬∑ Related Concepts & Theories ¬∑/Learn\|learning]]. 
Solo book reading impacts Si + Ni. So ESXP hate reading books. They like having other people read a book to them so it becomes a shared experience.

‚ÄúYou must have enough confidence to begin [[CARDS/¬∑ Related Concepts & Theories ¬∑/Learn\|learning]] and enough humility to keep learning. The reality and deeper implication of the model is that some pride is required for a dynamic validation. If someone has no confidence in their own thinking, how can they validate anyone or anything?‚Äù ([[CARDS/Individuals/CS Joseph\|CS Joseph]], S7E22/23?)

# Description
Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman explains how everybody can learn much faster using "Gap Effects" and other learning techniques. Andrew Huberman reveals truth about studying and gives out best tips and tricks for quicker studying. We all have to learn throughout our lives, so we can improve and become better and more knowledgeable. A lot of people are studying in wrong way, which decreases their results by a huge margin. You don't have to ask how to study better or learn faster anymore! Well-known neuroscientist Andrew Huberman has revealed the best study tips for everybody, and some of them might shock you! Andrew Huberman is an American neuroscientist and associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine who has made many contributions to the brain development, brain plasticity, and neural regeneration and repair fields.
