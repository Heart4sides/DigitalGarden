	 - Anxiety = Worry + Stress
	 - Worry = when the mind dwells on negative thoughts 
	 - "repetitive, obsessive thoughts"
- What Worry really does to your brain
	- "apolsky explained that when we're stressed, two areas of the brain crucial to learning and memory, the hippocampus and frontal cortex, are flooded with hormones called glucocorticoids, which help our body prioritize what's most important in a crisis. These hormones maximize our strength and energy‚Äîin case we need to flee a predator, for example‚Äîwhile temporarily shutting down less essential functions, such as maintaining connections between neurons in our brain. (You don't want to spend precious mental energy consolidating memories when you're trying to outrun a saber-toothed tiger.) But chronic stress has us releasing glucocorticoids nonstop. "As a result, the hippocampus and frontal cortex continually back-burner their housekeeping duties of cleaning up connections between neurons," says Sapolsky. Over time, that can cause these neurons to function poorly, potentially leaving us vulnerable to cognitive decline."
	- "So while the neurons I may have damaged during my months of fretting might be damaged for good, it's possible that once the glucocorticoid flood subsides, the brain may begin creating new neural pathways and potentially even new neurons"
