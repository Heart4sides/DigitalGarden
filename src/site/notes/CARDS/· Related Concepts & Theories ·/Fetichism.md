## Wikipedia 
> A fetish (derived from the French fétiche, which comes from the Portuguese feitiço, and this in turn from Latin facticius, 'artificial' and facere, 'to make') is an object believed to have supernatural powers, or in particular, a human-made object that has power over others. Essentially, fetishism is the attribution of inherent value, or powers, to an object.

## [Idols & Fetiches by James B. Smiley](https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2574&context=ocj)
"Hence, since a feitico is, properly speaking, a tangible and inanimate object alone, fetichism can properly only mean the worship of such objects. The practice of propitiating by offerings beings who are believed to dwell in the woods or mountains, the rivers or the sea, is not fetichism: nor is the worship paid to certain animals by particular tribes fetichism. Neither can the worship of idols be so termed."
