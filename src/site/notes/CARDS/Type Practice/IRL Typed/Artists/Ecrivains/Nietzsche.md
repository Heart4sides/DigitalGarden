"Nos pensées sont les ombres de nos émotions" - Le Gai Savoir 
 
**

Nietzsche believed that the Stoics are deluded in thinking that buried within those rules of nature is an ideal path that human beings could follow. This is “virtue”, which for the Stoics was one and the same as “living according to nature.”

But for a skeptical philosopher like Nietzsche there is no ideal notion of “virtue” that is waiting for human beings to discover. Rather than conform to an imagined ideal behavior, Nietzsche believed that people ought to find their own way.

I'm in the process of listening to every major philosopher while going on long walks listening to audiobook and typing them based on their preference of the cognitive functions.

  

It is obvious Nietzche is an INTJ as he constantly emphasizes the cognitive functions of the INTJ.  Including the phrase "the will (Ni) to power (Te/Se)" and his Fi child optimism that he better understands morals (Fi) than most others. 

  

In Nietzche's book "Good and Evil" is found the following statement that puts his preferred cognitive functions in order when he states:

  

"The fundamental will of the spirit (Ni) aims for appearance (Te).....The feeling (Fi) of increased power (Se) is its object."

  

As such I've also typed Thomas Aquinas as an INTJ (and not INTP) because, like fellow Se user Aristotle, he saw ultimate external reality primarily as concrete (Se) as opposed to abstract as Ne user Socrates saw it.  And Aquinas constantly presents other's ideas with Te parent, and dissects them with Ti critic.
