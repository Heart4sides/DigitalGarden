The Grinch 

They wanna ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ne üíß\|Ne üíß]]) use their little quality time ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fe üíâ\|Fe üíâ]]) with the Grinch 
I guess I could use a little social interaction 
Am I just eating bc I'm [[bored\|bored]] ? 
I don't know why I ever leave this place 
He had no sense of colour coordination
A town full of loosers - I like it 
Wallow in self pity
Stare into the abyss 
Wrestle with my self loathing 
Allow them to [[SOURCES/Type Theory by CSJ/Temples/Heart Temple/Satisfaction Dyad/Envy by CSJ\|Envy by CSJ]] me 
If you're not going to help me then you might as well..
Steals the gifts ([[SOURCES/Type Theory by CSJ/Functions/Wayfarer by CSJ\|Wayfarer by CSJ]])
Desacration : Kill the sacred cow --> Christmas 
Maybe Christian doesn't come from a store maybe Christmas means a little bit more
Help me, I'm feeling !
