The KEY ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi🧭]]) moment ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Se\|Se🌪️]]) in people’s life is when their living legacy is most vulnerable = Pregnancy🤰 

What is required for the child’s prosperity, one must FIRST provide it to oneself : 
Alignment ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Soul Temple👤\|Soul👥]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi🧭]]) → Peace ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Heart Temple🎭\|Heart🎭]][[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fe\|Fe💉]]) → Knowledge ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Mind Temple🛠️\|Mind⚒️]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ti\|Ti🗡️]]) → Prosperity ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Body Temple 🌳\|Body🌳]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Te\|Te🏹]]). 

- [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Woman🙎‍♀️\|Women🙎‍♀️]] must have **self-respect** 
	- ==Why ?== [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Woman🙎‍♀️\|Women🙎‍♀️]]‘s [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Si\|Si⛰️]] needs + [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi🧭]] feelings = Fetus👶’ health = Woman🙎‍♀️’s value

		- Put their value ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi🧭]]) and needs ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Si\|Si⛰️]]) above everything else. 
		- Attend to one’s sense of security ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Si\|Si⛰️]]) by being [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ne\|Ne💧]] desirable 
		- Attend to one’s sense of value ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi🧭]]) by being [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Te\|Te🏹]] highly regarded 
	- ==Effect ?==

		- They will have [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Fi\|Fi🧭]] integrity and [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Foundational/Ne\|Ne💧]] desirability = [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Intimacy\|Intimacy]] + [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Justification\|Justification]]

		- = Fetus👶’ health 
		- One can only desire & care for others if one desires and cares for oneself. The [[Self🌓\|Self🌓]] wants to be desired and cared for. If the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Ego🙋‍♂️\|Ego🙋‍♂️]] rejects the Self, the Self will fight for self-love against the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Ego🙋‍♂️\|Ego🙋‍♂️]] through the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Superego👹\|Superego👹]] with destructive means, which makes the man dangerous to the woman. 
	- ==How ?==
