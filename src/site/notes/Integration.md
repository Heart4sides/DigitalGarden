# Quotes 
> “Wholeness is not achieved by cutting off a portion of one’s being, but by integration of the contraries” ([[CARDS/Individuals/C.G. Jung\|C.G. Jung]])

> “The scope of the integration is suggested by the descensus ad inferos, the descent of Christ's soul to hell, its work of redemption embracing even the dead. The psychological equivalent of this is the integration of the collective unconscious which forms an essential part of the individuation process.” ([[CARDS/Individuals/C.G. Jung\|C.G. Jung]])

> “One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore not popular.” ([[CARDS/Individuals/C.G. Jung\|C.G. Jung]])
