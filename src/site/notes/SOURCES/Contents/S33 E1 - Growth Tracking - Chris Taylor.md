# Transcript from Yourube
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=0) [Music] hey [Applause] [Music] how's it going everyone this is chris 
[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=19) taylor with cs joseph.life your host for season 33 cognitive growth tracking in this season we're going to be taking a look at the 16 types 
[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=30) how to integrate the four sides of the mind as well as grow the functions uh in each we're going to be going over some themes for the four sides 
[00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=40) what they kind of encompass thematically and how they all interplay with each other some of you may recognize me from the videos i've been on with chase namely 
[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=52) the most recent one being how doesn't a shadow-focused intj develop their subconscious this is going to be similar along those lines but a lot more in depth 
[01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=62) um and it's going to be incorporating all four sides of the mind instead of just one and for all 16 types the other places you may recognize me from is the facebook and discord 
[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=74) communities some of you may know me as raqqa from the discord communities um and then finally uh the articles that i have been on with john boden 
[01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=84) um if you have not read in particular the articles going over the reflector functions as well as the battlegrounds i highly recommend you 
[01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=96) pause the video here go check out those articles because they are going to be pretty integral to your understanding of what we are talking about especially in relation to the superego 
[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=108) those links will be down in the description below for those following along on youtube for those on spotify there should be a link somewhere down there for you as well 
[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=119) that all being said um let's get right into it without wasting too much time here now this is going to be episode one now if you look at the chart i have here 
[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=136) we have the four sides of the mind it's the same four sides that we are all used to we have the ego the subconscious the shadow and the super ego nothing really new there 
[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=148) as well as access orbit and reflection the three basic concepts we've been discussing on how the four sides of the mind interact with each other what we haven't really talked about 
[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=159) before is the ego the point of origin so you have ego which is the origin the subconscious which is axis the shadow which is orbit 
[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=172) and the superego which is reflection one more thing before we delve too far into this um chase and i have unfortunately made a bit a bit of a 
[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=187) let's say disservice in explaining how the um how you transition or the concept of 
[03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=198) being stuck in a side of the mind so i do want to take a moment to kind of clarify what we mean when we say stuck in the side of 
[03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=208) the mind it does not mean that you are exclusively in that side and that is where your you your your mind is resting at rather what it means

> [03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=221)  When you are "stuck in a side of the mind" (or what we have previously called that), [it means] you have one of these other sides more developed than your ego, and this is going to be the side that you rely on first in order to solve any kind of problems you may have. That still doesn't mean that you're spending more time in that side than your ego. It just means that is your brain's gut reaction to any problems or challenges it may be encountering. However with the ego it is still very important to make that your point of origin [...], that you at least consciously try to use your ego first before you try to jump straight into another side of the mind because if your mental point of origin if you're trying to make that your subconscious or your shadow this is going to create [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/chaotic transitions\|chaotic transitions]] whether that's into that side of the mind itself or back into the ego 


[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=294) now with these four sides they each have kind of a theme in which they are interacting there's a bigger kind of uh a wider scope theme 
[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=309) which is that axis orbit reflection and origin and then there is a smaller scope theme so for the ego the theme is alignment the axis the theme is exchange 
[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=322) orbit the theme is depth and superego the theme is revelation now with the ego 
[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=335) the theme is alignment because again we are trying to set up a conscious effort and path in order to um orderly transition between the sides of the mind and integrate them 
[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=352) with the ego the reason it is alignment is because you need to have that starting point each one of these functions within that 
[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=362) theme your hero parent child and inferior follow this theme in a similar way starting off with a hero we have the theme of discovery 
[06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=374) now this is kind of twofold a the brain uses the hero function to discover it is a 
[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=383) very active function it's virtually always on and it is the way that your brain discovers other things it is because of that heroic energy that 
[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=396) the hero function has because of the way that it is at that apex of the mind it can be utilized almost indefinitely 
[06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=407) now this is problematic when it comes to actually developing um the sides of the mind because you there tends to be an over reliance on that function 
[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=419) you need to be able to eventually let that go after you have that starting point but for those of you that are either subconscious or shadow focused um 
[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=430) and you have more development in those sides of the mind than the ego itself it's going to be very important to learn about this hero function because you need to discover that apex of your mind 
[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=442) so there is an internal and external component to that to that discovery next up you have the parent function and it is the anchor point for the ego it grounds you 
[07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=457) in your ego as far as excuse me as far as uh restricting this hero function from going around and basically 
[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=467) destroying the city so to speak we always you know make that analogy about how the hero just flies around and causes collateral damage wherever it goes 
[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=476) much like you know heroes and comic books and things like that this parent function is that responsibility in the ego that reigns in that power of the hero 
[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=486) function and gives it a little bit of caution next up we have the child function this is a function of rest so 
[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=498) in the ego the way that your brain aligns itself with the child function is rest and relaxation recovery enjoyment it's a function that you have fun with 
[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=511) for me as an enfp tea child really enjoys taking creating frameworks tearing apart frameworks researching ideas and concepts and that is highly important at the end 
[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=525) of the day your ego is where you're going to be spending the most of your time in an ideal situation especially in earlier phases of life having that point that you can come back 
[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=536) to and realign yourself and rest in is incredibly important it is a source of innocence it is a function much like the hero that is on almost regularly because it is that 
[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=552) origin point of the mind and it is that function that we tend to rest in and then finally we have the inferior function 
[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=563) and the key to alignment with the inferior is vulnerability this is understanding that you do have those vulnerabilities understanding what the vulnerabilities 
[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=574) are and when you're in your ego and eventually trying to develop your subconscious getting over those um insecurities and those vulnerabilities 
[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=587) and that pretty much does it for the ego as far as the point of origin here next up we have the subconscious this is the concept of axes this is the hero function linked to the 
[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=601) inferior and the parent function linked to the child now an axis is all about an exchange a balance you lose on this side to gain on this 
[10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=614) side access and exchange of the subconscious is all about trading in the weakness of the ego the weakest points of the ego 
[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=626) and making them stronger it's also about trading pessimism for optimism and vice versa so 
[10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=636) with the inferior function we through accepting and overcoming that vulnerability we lose or we trade we exchange 
[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=649) that insecurity which causes vulnerability for flexibility which causes the inferior to have the heroic strength 
[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=660) more so than even the hero function because of its journey of overcoming those weaknesses next step we have the child function 
[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=672) which through diligence exchanges its rest for hard work in order to grow and develop this is how it ends up becoming more 
[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=685) responsible it trades in that rest it no longer the child function is no longer just simply resting on its laurels and doing what it does naturally 
[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=696) it puts more effort in in order or you put more effort in with it and create diligence this creates a sense of responsibility 
[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=706) it's what grows your child next up we have the parent function the parent function exchanges it's an incessant need to control and to kind of stifle 
[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=719) in order to find a more innocent approach to things and in doing so gains freedom it's allowed to be optimistic it's allowed to be a child again 
[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=733) it also is able to do this because in this transition in this exchange into the subconscious the parent function is no longer having to micromanage the 
[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=745) hero function that's already given up its need to be the hero to be the discoverer to save the day 
[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=756) so it is allowed to be more innocent which touches right into the hero function itself which by giving up its discovery its need to save the day constantly 
[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=774) to have that heroic power to embrace its own vulnerabilities and now that the inferior has overcome its vulnerabilities and is able to step up and take the position of that hero 
[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=788) function the hero can retire at least temporarily it can take a break and in that the hero finds happiness there is a long time there where i 
[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=800) mistakenly believed that the inferior is where that source of happiness came from when you transitioned into the subconscious but the inferior isn't actually becoming 
[13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=812) happy per se it it's relieved to overcome these vulnerabilities but the hero function isn't where the happiness comes from they are the inferior excuse me isn't where the 
[13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=824) happiness comes from it's from the hero not needing to save the day constantly um there is a comic book with uh with superman where he basically gave up being superman he ended up settling down 
[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=839) starting a family had a farm and he was happy he was actually happy he was he he hung up his cape and it's very similar in this way the 
[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=849) hero function it doesn't need to do everything anymore it can let somebody else take the role it can hand over the reins to the function that was 
[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=860) originally a baby the inferior the infant that's essentially the way we look at axis it's it's a sense of exchange it's not a plus or minus 
[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=876) it's a this for that it's a trade equivalent exchange it's all about taking the weakness and making it strength 
[14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=888) taking the strength and finding humility in the weakness that it has next up we have the shadow which is represented of representative of cognitive orbit 
[15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=905) the theme here is depth the shadow is the other is is part of the other half of the mind it's the lower functions it's the four functions that 
[15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=916) we don't have incorporated into our ego it is the other side of the coin it's represented here by a venn diagram because it's a bit of an overlap 
[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=928) now the shadow adds and subtracts from the ego in a pessimistic form it is going to subtract from the ego in 
[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=941) an optimistic form is going to add to the ego so here we have the nemesis 
[15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=952) nemesis is going to add or subtract perspective so how does it do this the hero's flying around the city it's discovering 
[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=963) but the hero still has a very limited range of vision because it is locked into the mentality of having to do it all that actually narrows its ability to discover 
[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=977) in an early transition the nemesis is actually adding perspective and think about it you have for me and any hero 
[16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=989) you have an eye nemesis right those are both two halves of the intuition function as a whole one is looking at what others desire and 
[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=999) what is looking at its own desires right a future point in time for ni in essence and everyone else's future points for the extroverted intuition 
[16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1012) having both sides of that coin is adding depth to the intuition function as a whole the hero has more perspective to see when it's not treating the nemesis as 
[17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1025) an enemy as a villain it's able to actually incorporate this other perspective it's more holistic next up we have the critic 
[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1038) the critic is going to add or subtract humility to the parent function now how is it how is it uh adding and 
[17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1050) subtracting humility this works whether or not you have an extroverted or an introverted critic and vice versa for the parent function see the parent function as we spoke 
[17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1065) about before well i mean it kind of has a stick up its ass right it's 
[17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1073) and it needs to because it's constantly trying to deal with this irresponsible hero that's causing all the damage and destruction um 
[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1083) you know and not it it's collateral it's not that it's directly damaging it's just it's got too much strength to it right so that that anchor point of the parent 
[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1096) is necessary but the parent takes its job a little too seriously which can be prideful right 
[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1107) oh nobody else is going to say something to this hero function i need to i need to i need to keep it held down i need to be that 
[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1117) anchor but that's not always wise right that's definitely not humble right this critic takes that other half of the 
[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1130) coin that other perspective and shows the parent that it's not always right that its way of going about things is not always the effective way of going 
[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1142) about it if this critic is actually listened to listening um and vice versa between the parent and the critic there is a level of humility there 
[19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1155) that sense of responsibility the parent is able to see that it might be too much at times or it might not be enough at times but it's able to compare and contrast do you 
[19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1165) have an extroverted critic your in uh your introverted parent is feeling so responsible with his own internal perception or judgment 
[19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1177) that it's shutting out the critic side of things the extroverted side of things that's not why sticking your head in the sand is not why saying oh i've i already 
[19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1187) know what i'm doing not wise and it's not humble that's arrogant right so 
[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1201) when the critic actually comes into play here it lets it it basically tells the parent hey you're you can't handle it all on your own 
[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1212) if you have an extroverted parent you spend so much time either pers trying to be responsible with your perception of others or 
[20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1222) what other people are doing or the other you're not taking time to think things through or or perceive 
[20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1231) internally you have nothing to compare to and therefore you end up hypocritical so that depth 
[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1243) for the critic is adding humility to the parent next up we have the trickster function

[20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1255) the [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Trickster🤡\|Trickster🤡]] is looking at adding or subtracting [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Curiosity\|Curiosity]] from the child we've spoken about it before but

the trickster function is a black hole at the end of the day 
[21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1266) it's never enough ti trickster a truth or a logical idea is not enough 
[21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1277) because the concept of [[framework\|framework]] or how things are framed the context is always there for te child 
[21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1288) so that ti while it may be true in a certain situation may not be perceived as true in another one it doesn't make d child right mind you 
[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1299) but that black hole of the trickster function is adding curiosity to the child it's adding that well what about this 
[21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1311) well what about that well what about this could it work like this could it work like that now 
[22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1320) the trickster funny enough he it is trying to take the role of this parent function [Music] 
[22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1330) and that's where we're getting into the cognitive battlegrounds but it's trying to take the role of that parent function and while it's acting like it knows 
[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1341) things it's creating situations where this child is put in situations where the child is wrong or incorrect or what have you and through that the child 
[22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1354) goes back okay well i need to reassess i need to learn more 

[22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1354) In a chaotic transition this [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Trickster🤡\|Trickster🤡]] is ignored. The [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Child👼\|Child👼]] rests on its laurels and becomes that know-it-all - and we all know kids that end up as those know-it-alls because they're trying to be responsible with an idea or maybe even a function that they're not quite ready to actually be responsible with, maybe they lack the experience right ; it's the same way with the trickster when we try to know with the trickster for example and this is especially true with ti trickster. The child ends up resting on its laurels and that curiosity dies out. You can't fill a cup that's already full. So the trickster will add or subtract curiosity from the child.

[23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1421) we have the demon function the demon function is interesting in that it will always add but there's a bit of nuance here 
[23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1435) so the trickster is always adding adversity it's always adding adversity the difference is whether or not the inferior can handle that adversity 
[24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1447) see the key with that is it's not on the actual function the demon function the onus is on whether or not the inferior is going to ignore 
[24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1459) or is going to accept the adversity that the demon function is adding to the inferior and in this this is one way that the demon function is trying to subvert 
[24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1474) the hero function the hero functions hold on the mind because the demon is adding adversity to the inferior and constantly the inferior being the weak point of the hero 
[24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1488) function that is basically lex luthor constantly holding kryptonite to superman so with this it's about it goes back to the onus of the ego in this case to 
[25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1504) handle that adversity your demon function is always going to try to overtake the ego it needs to this inspires growth in the brain 
[25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1515) right if we take away all the characterizations for a moment these functions can be looked at as simply pathways in the brain the brain is always going to want the 
[25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1527) path of least resistance in order to develop um and grow and become better 
[25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1538) and because it's wanting the path of least resistance there's going to be times where the pathway to the repressed demon function repressed because it is mirrored to the 
[25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1548) hero and this is where understanding how the reflection functions work is comes into play but 
[25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1556) because the demon is trying to overtake that hero function because the brain wants access to this function that's being repressed 
[26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1567) by the reflecting function it's going to create situations where you're not properly able to get the feedback or information from that mirror from that demon function 
[26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1582) which is linked in orbit to the inferior which is a source of insecurity and use function wise your brain has stable access to that function but second guesses itself 
[26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1595) because of its relationship on an axis with the hero so through that your brain is always going to put you into situations 
[26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1606) these may be four sides it's one brain eight functions your brain just wants to be able to utilize all these functions in trying to utilize that reflected function you're going to create 
[26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1617) situations that hit your own inferior function and take away your ego bias with the function your brain does best with 
[27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1630) so the mind is always trying to get back into balance because that balance allows for a flexibility across the entire brain that allows it it was looking for to be 
[27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1644) whole and to be in balance with itself and finally to be able to alternate between the reflected functions in order to handle any situation that is 
[27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1656) thrown at it so we we like to characterize it a lot oh this is a demonic function it's it's only characterized that way because the function itself is a 
[27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1670) repressed function when our brain goes to use it it's going to be chaotic likely until the end stages in phase of 
[28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1680) your life when you're actually able to utilize that function you're able to let go of your insecurities you're able to listen to the other halves of your 
[28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1690) functions and you're able to let go of your bias for these functions in the ego and then you're able to get to reflection 
[28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1703) the theme for reflection is revelation what this superego site is doing via reflection is revealing the issues with your ego biases 
[28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1719) the demon is reverent revealing the arrogance the hubris that your hero function has we did talk a little bit about the parents arrogance but they're a bit 
[28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1731) different they're similar in the sense that being egotistical here and sticking with your own biases for 
[29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1744) your ego functions is arrogant the demon function is revealing the arrogance of the hero 
[29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1759) next up is the trickster the trickster is revealing the complacency of the parent function it's kind of funny 
[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1771) because the parent function is the last function to really develop to come online in the ego which is complacent in and of itself but the thing is 
[29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1782) when we talk about the battlegrounds and these um reflector functions your trickster is an optimistic function that is trying to fill the same role as your parent 
[29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1798) now keep in mind pessimistic functions are reactionary they tend to come online as needed they take a lot more energy to use there are less developed pathways and 
[30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1812) they have a heavier negativity bias to them people don't really like dealing with negativity bias all the time 
[30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1824) plain and simple why would you why would most people from a nature standpoint want to focus on the negative complicates life and in the short run it's easier and perceivingly 
[30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1838) better to focus on optimism and just being happy but it's a lie that we're telling ourselves that happiness is short-lived 
[30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1850) arrogance right the only choice here really is to grow so that trickster when you have a optimistic function filling the same 
[31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1863) role as a pessimistic one it's going to be easier for the optimistic function to fill that slot through orbit the tr 
[31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1876) we have in order the hero develops comes online first and through orbit the nemesis comes online next to develop is the child function 
[31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1892) so your optimistic functions are the first ones to come into play and through orbit the trickster comes into play so what ends up happening 
[31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1904) is the nemesis takes the role of the inferior and the trickster takes the role of the parent then as we develop through age through 
[31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1915) life the inferior function comes online when we start becoming insecure with a function we have social faux pas right because when you're only working 
[32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1926) off your hero nemesis child and trickster the scope of functions you're realistically utilizing right is very limited so the amount of 
[32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1936) situations you are equipped to deal with is going to be smaller and because of that we end up having social faux pas as kids 
[32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1950) and this ends up developing insecurity this could be insecurity developed through you know friend groups it could be from your parents um projecting onto 
[32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1963) you it could be from any number of factors in life but at the end of the day what it really comes down to is you are ill-equipped for a situation that 
[32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1971) happened and this caused consequence and suddenly these optimistic functions aren't enough it's not enough to just be a happy kid 
[33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1983) anymore now you have worries and insecurities now and to characterize it again the hero thinking that the nemesis was covering 
[33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=1995) its weakness the heroes lost faith in the nemesis so now it stops listening to the nemesis and the inferior 
[33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2011) well the hero is obviously afraid of that so this is where the difference comes in between worry and insecurity with the hero and the nemesis function 
[33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2024) or with the inferior in the nemesis function excuse me the the hero is worried that the nemesis is unable to do its job and so you second guess your use of that 
[33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2035) function because at the end of the day it's what ended up creating the insecurity in the first place i guess i have to do everything myself says the hero 
[34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2053) and then then you have the inferior is that source of insecurity that was created 
[34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2064) this is the kryptonite to the hero function they're linked together as well so the hero is digging in even deeper to its own bias 
[34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2075) in itself to not have to worry about that inferior function if i'm strong enough that i don't need to use it then i'll be just fine 
[34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2088) i'll just keep going with my hero function for any hero it's literally i'll figure out all the possibilities that could possibly happen 
[34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2099) i'll figure out what everybody wants so that i am never put into a situation that'll make me uncomfortable and then i don't have to worry about what i want 
[35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2112) and getting into an a bad situation that again getting into a bad situation the inferior so it digs even deeper into itself 
[35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2126) sometimes in life as we develop we some people just cannot get back to that ego though right this is where you end 
[35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2137) up with the sub or the shadow focus people that feel like they're stuck in that side of the mind when in reality they're keeping themselves in a situation that's not hospitable 
[35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2147) to who they naturally are so please if you're in a situation where you can't be in your ego you can't be relaxed with who you are and that includes your vulnerabilities 
[36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2161) and being okay with those vulnerabilities you need to change your situation and i don't care if that means cutting out family or friends 
[36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2171) because at the end of the day if they care if you care about them and they care about you right but they're 
[36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2180) it's just there's maybe an incompatibility there and they're putting you into a situation that's not allowing you to be you that's not good for you and if they 
[36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2190) truly care about you they wouldn't want that anyway most people just aren't aware enough of how these cognitive functions work they don't understand type and so we go 
[36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2203) around stepping on each other's toes projecting on each other constantly we can't change everyone else but we can understand ourselves enough 
[36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2217) to set ourselves up into a situation that works better for us because at the end of the day for those of you that are worried about cutting out family members and friends 
[37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2231) the people that care about you want you to be able to be happy if they truly do care about you you need you need to take the responsibility to put yourself into that 
[37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2242) situation that huge rant aside to pull us back in from the any hero tangent um 
[37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2256) [Music] the critic the the trickster is revealing complacency in that parent function 
[37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2265) because at the end of the day if the parent function was there from the get-go you probably wouldn't have ended up in the situation to begin with that would 
[37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2277) have caused you to need would have caused the insecurity and the trickster continually with its misunderstanding internally of the function 
[38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2290) with the static i i'll say the static noise um that overpowers the trickster function because of how low it is in the function 
[38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2301) stack because of that it's going to continue to create situations that are bad for the child function 
[38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2314) it's going to create continue to create situations that make your vulnerabilities more 
[38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2323) of an insecurity the trickster is essentially the trojan horse that the demon function has into the ego side of the mind again when we talked about shadow it 
[39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2340) adds curiosity never forget the importance of that trickster function but also understand that that trickster function 
[39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2353) is a function you're not ready to actually be responsible with yet leave it as a curiosity when you understand what your trickster function is and how it applies 
[39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2368) you still want to listen to what it has to say but verify everything that it has to say this is the function that cause that should be causing you to ask questions 
[39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2382) and breathe that thirst of curiosity into your mind it is not to run rampant as the parent it is to inspire and question 
[39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2395) so that you can grow but when your parent is allowing the trickster to take its role your parent is being complacent that's the revelation 
[40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2409) next up we have the critic function the critic function reveals the ignorance of the child function and it doesn't do so directly 
[40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2425) rather your critic function isn't thinking of your child function as ignorant it's more that your critic function is ignorant 
[40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2435) itself it's high enough into the function stack that you're utilizing it and every time your critic is being a hypocrite and running its mouth 
[40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2449) that child function that reflection is walking the same path it's that kid trying to be like the grumpy old man it's it's kind of 
[41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2462) interesting there's there's um there's a phenomenon in our media where you have these kind of um [Music] 
[41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2473) i don't know what to call them they're not anti-heroes but you have characters like tyler durden right or these really the these really 
[41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2484) really troubled uh guys or girls what have you and you have children admiring the cynicism 
[41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2495) inherent in those characters and so the child starts to try to emulate it tries to take that role kid wants to be just like that crotchety 
[41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2509) old man that seems like a badass but is really kind of up because he's a hypocrite and he hasn't spent his life developing 
[41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2518) and learning and listening whether that's an introverted or extroverted function and so 
[42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2526) the child function a function that should be innocent and learning and curious is now taking on aspects of cynicism and it comes across very ignorant 
[42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2539) ignorant well if that old man seems to have it all figured out i can just emulate him and i'll have it all figured out and guess what 
[42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2551) your trickster gets shut out your child is now resting on its laurels and it's being ignorant then finally we have the nemesis function 
[42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2568) the nemesis function reveals the fear in our inferior function with this nemesis function it is again mirrored to the inferior 
[43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2587) and it goes back to kind of that whole origin point i was talking about with the development of the inferior because for me nsi inferior 
[43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2602) if i'm scared of my vulnerabilities afraid of new experiences afraid of having a bad experience how can i possibly 
[43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2615) trust my decisions for my future with my and i how could i possibly select a valid point in time in the future 
[43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2626) if i am afraid of what's going to happen the experience i'm going to have and that hesitation in the use of the nemesis 
[44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_1xfd_Kt8&t=284s&t=2641) shows how scared you are in your inferior how afraid you are this is where
