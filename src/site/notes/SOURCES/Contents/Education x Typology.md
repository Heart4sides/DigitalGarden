## Introverted Thinking

Ti users learn by themselves. They internalize the inputs to create new knowledge with a deductive process : if this, then that.

They are subject to:

-   Preferred input : Choosing their entrant based on what maintains their comfort or freedom of choice. Come to their conclusion first, then look only for external evidence of their correctness.
    
-   Relying on the last input : once they think they have found the truth, they are likely not to update their thinking by looking for more recent data
    
-   Echo chamber: tend to dismiss people who disagree with them as stupid. So that their reasoning is reinforced by those around them selected according to their agreement with them.
    

They respect the opinions of others by using their Fe, when:

-   They have the humility to know that the only thing they really know is that they know nothing
    
-   They perceive that people are attached to their beliefs and that invalidating those beliefs hurts them
    
-   So they will only correct what they can deductively prove
    
-   It is by listening to the opinions of others that they can gather new input to perfect their thinking¬†

# Temples Integration for the Mind 

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



# Temple Integration
| Orbit (Shadow)            | Body Temple<br/>Without action education ends up creating an affiliative environment which has no basis on survival of the fittest. Then people are not fit at all. The working environment has no respect for education because they know how much it's a scam. Education then becomes a buffer to hide from reality.                                                                                   |  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Axis (Superego)           | Heart Temple<br/>Without passion and purpose people will lack the willingness to keep learning. Learning without the heart leads educators to become pussies who never test what they teach nor refine their teaching to reflect reality.                                                                                                                                                                |  |
| Reflection (Subconscious) | Soul Temple<br/>Good education helps someone discover who they are and discover a sense of self they can focus on and moral integrity. all the standardization that receipt today destroys the individual soul taking part in the education. it chokes out the individual voices that education is supposed to protect. education that does not treat students as humans should be set on fire.          |
