For example, ==conscientiousness predicts hierarchical rank better than extraversion in task-oriented organizations like an engineering firm, but extraversion predicts rank in more socially-oriented organizations, such as a consulting firm (Anderson, Spataro, & Flynn, in press). Similarly, in groups that require little coordination amongst their members, individuals with assertive speaking styles are conferred more status than individuals with tentative speaking styles, but the opposite is true for high coordination groups (Fragale, 2006).== Extraversion is the basis for d*

People in positions of power are able to set agendas, norms for discussion, rules for behavior, and standards for thought and opinion, all of which constrain the psychological freedom experienced by individuals lower in the hierarchy. Low-power individuals obey the explicit demands of high-power individuals (Milgram, 1974) and are also easily influenced by their more subtle attempts at persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). The world of those who have little power is filled with real and psychological shackles whereas possessing power is often equated with freedom (Hollander, 1958).== One of the best ways to demons*

For example, high-power individuals are also more likely than those without power to openly express their opinions during a group discussion (Anderson & Berdahl, 2002; Berdahl & Martorana, 2006).== In contrast, low-power individu*

These research findings were all motivated by one influential theory, the Power-Approach Theory (Keltner et al., 2003), which claims that possessing power increases the tendency to focus on and approach attractive aspects of situations. This theory is based on two features of power dynamics. First, elevated power is associated with increased access to rewards. Second, power-holders encounter less interference from others when pursuing those rewards.== For complementary  reasons, low*

In the upper echelons of organizations, this plays out with more powerful CEOs leading their organizations through more strategic change than less powerful CEOs (Greve & Mitsuhashi, 2007; Pfeffer, 1981). In bargaining contexts, those higher in power are also more likely to initiate a negotiation and to make the first offer (Magee, Galinsky, & Gruenfeld, 2007). Negotiating and making first offers have both been shown to reliably lead to the accumulation of more resources and thus more power (e.g., Babcock & Laschever, 2003; Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001).== For example, Babcock and Lasche*

For example, ==optimism in many cases leads directly to increased performance; for example, feelings of self-efficacy are associated with higher motivation, more efforts to succeed, and increased performance (Bandura, 1977; 1986) and thus the retention of or even increase in their hierarchical rank.== Although, power-holders are mor*

In negotiations, high-power parties typically respond less to their counterpart’s emotional displays than do low-power parties (Van Kleef, De Dreu, Pietroni, & Manstead, 2006).== In another type of conflict, a*

(2006) found that high-power individuals are simply less likely to spontaneously adopt another’s visual perspective, less likely to take another person’s background knowledge, and less accurate in judging others’ facial expressions of emotion.== That is, power affects the tend*

This negative effect of power on perspective-taking is important because perspective-taking reduces stereotyping and derogation (Galinsky & Moskowitz, 2000), and the possession of power has been associated with an increased reliance on stereotypes and the derogation of subordinates (Fiske, 1993; Georgesen & Harris, 1998, 2000; Goodwin, Gubin, Fiske, & Yzerbyt, 2000, but see Overbeck & Park, 2001).== As we detail below, these proce*

>*orcing the hierarchical order. ==Despite these apparent deficits in social perception, when high-power individuals are motivated to attend to specific features of others, they are especially attentive to instrumental   ones. In particular, power-holders show remarkable focus on perceive individuals who possess characteristics that would be useful for the power-holder with remarkable focus (Gruenfeld, Inesi, Magee, & Galinsky, in press). Gruenfeld et al. (in press) describe this phenomenon as an association between power and objectification—the tendency to view others through an instrumental lens, as means to an end. As a result, the powerful attend to and approach others only to the extent that they are useful, regardless of their other human qualities (Gruenfeld et al., in press). There can be interpersonal costs of objectification. For example, Overbeck and Park (2006) found that when the powerful were assigned goals related to achieving an efficient workplace, they recalled less correct information about their subordinates and were less able to distinguish their unique characteristics.== Electronic copy available at: h*

When the powerful are focused on their own personal goals, the organization’s interests can be compromised.== This power-objectification rel*
