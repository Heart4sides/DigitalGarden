## Essentialism
> "Essentialists believe that there is a common core of knowledge ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fe 💉\|Fe 💉]]) that needs to be transmitted to students in a [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Systematic 🔧\|Systematic 🔧]], [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Si 🏔️\|disciplined]] ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]) way."
> "The emphasis in this conservative perspective is on  intellectual and moral [[CARDS/Related Concepts & Theories/Standard\|standards]] ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Te 🏹\|Te 🏹]]) that schools should teach"
> "Schooling should be practical, preparing students to become valuable members of society ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fe 💉\|Fe 💉]])."
> "It should focus on facts ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ti 🗡️\|Ti 🗡️]]) -the objective reality ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Se 🌪️\|Se 🌪️]]) out there--and "the basics," training students to read, write, speak, and compute clearly and logically ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ti 🗡️\|Ti 🗡️]])."
> "Students should be taught hard work, [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Reverance\|respect]] for [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Authority\|Authority]], and [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Si 🏔️\|discipline]]" [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]  [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Mind Temple ⚒️\|Mind Temple ⚒️]] 

## Progressivism
> "Progressivists believe that education should focus on the whole child, rather than on the content or the teacher." [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Soul Temple 👥\|Soul Temple 👥]]
> "This educational philosophy stresses that students should test ideas ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Abstract\|Abstract]]) by active [[CARDS/Related Concepts & Theories/Experimentation\|Experimentation]] ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Concrete\|Concrete]])." 
> "Learning is rooted in the questions of learners that arise through experiencing the world ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]). It is active ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Initiating\|extraverted]]), not passive. The learner is a problem solver and thinker ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ti 🗡️\|Ti 🗡️]]) who makes meaning through his or her individual experience in the physical ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]) and cultural ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]) context"
> "Effective teachers provide experiences so that students can learn by doing ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]])"
> "Curriculum content is derived from student [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Interest 🤝\|interests]] and questions."
> "The scientific [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Systematic 🔧\|method]] is used by progressivist educators so that students can study matter and events [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Systematic 🔧\|systematically]] and first hand. The emphasis is on [[process\|process]]- [[CARDS/Related Concepts & Theories/The How\|how]] one comes to know."
> "John Dewey was its foremost proponent. One of his tenets was that the school should improve the way of life ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Progression➕\|Progression➕]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]) of our citizens through  experiencing freedom ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ni 🔥\|Ni 🔥]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]]) and democracy in schools. Shared decision making ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Te 🏹\|Te 🏹]]), planning of teachers with students, student-selected topics are all aspects. Books are tools, rather than authority."

## Reconstructionism / Critical Theory
> "Social reconstructionism is a philosophy that emphasizes the addressing of social questions and a quest to create a better society and worldwide democracy" [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fe 💉\|Fe 💉]]
> "Critical theorists, like social reconstructionists, believe that systems ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Systematic 🔧\|Systematic 🔧]]) must be changed to overcome oppression and improve human conditions."
> "Curriculum focuses on student experience ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]) and taking social action on real problems ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fe 💉\|Fe 💉]]), such as violence, hunger, international terrorism, inflation, and inequality. Strategies for dealing with controversial issues (particularly in social studies and literature), inquiry, dialogue, and multiple perspectives ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ne 💧\|Ne 💧]]) are the focus. Community-based learning and bringing the world into the classroom ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Se 🌪️\|Se 🌪️]]) are also strategies."

## Ecclecticism 
> "draws upon multiple theories, styles, or ideas to gain complementary insights into a subject, or applies different theories in particular cases" [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ne 💧\|Ne 💧]]

## Existentialism
[[CARDS/Typing Individuals/IRL Typed/Artists/Ecrivains/Jean Paul Sartre\|Jean Paul Sartre]], [[CARDS/Typing Individuals/IRL Typed/Artists/Ecrivains/Nietzsche\|Nietzsche]], [[Kierkegaard\|Kierkegaard]]
> "While the famous existentialists would passionately disagree with one another on many basic philosophical issues, what they shared was a respect for individualism." [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]] 
> "In particular, they argued that traditional approaches to philosophy do not adequately respect the unique concerns of each individual." [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]
> "Jean Paul Sartre's classic formulation of existentialism--that "existence precedes essence"-- means that there exists no universal, inborn human nature. We are born and exist, and then we ourselves freely determine our essence (that is, our innermost nature)" [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ni 🔥\|Ni 🔥]]
> "Existentialism rejects the existence of any source of objective, authoritative truth  about metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Instead, individuals are responsible for determining for themselves what is "true" or "false," "right" or "wrong," "beautiful" or "ugly." For the existentialist, there exists no universal form of human nature; each of us has the free will to  develop as we see fit."[[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ni 🔥\|Ni 🔥]]-[[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]
> "In the existentialist classroom, subject matter takes second place to helping the students understand and appreciate themselves as unique individuals who accept complete responsibility for their thoughts, feelings, and actions" [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]], [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Mature 🐢\|maturity]]
> "The teacher's role is to help students define their own essence by exposing them to various paths they may take in life ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Ne 💧\|Ne 💧]]) and creating an environment ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Se 🌪️\|Se 🌪️]]) in which they may freely choose their own preferred ([[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]) way"
> "Since feeling is not divorced from reason in decision making, the existentialist demands the education of the whole person, not just the mind." [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Soul Temple 👥\|Soul Temple 👥]]
> "the humanities are commonly given tremendous emphasis. They are explored as a means of providing students with vicarious experiences that will help unleash their own creativity and self-expression. For example, rather than emphasizing historical events, existentialists focus upon the actions of historical individuals, each of whom provides possible models for the students' own behavior." [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Functions & Attitudes/Se 🌪️\|Se 🌪️]] 
> "In teaching art, existentialism encourages individual creativity and imagination more than copying and imitating established models." [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Abstract\|Abstract]] over [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Concrete\|Concrete]]
> "Learning is self-paced, self directed, and includes a great deal of individual contact with the teacher, who relates to each student openly and honestly." [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]], [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Sincerity\|Sincerity]] of ENTP
