## Perennialism
>[!Quote]- Perennialism 
>"For Perennialists, the aim of education is to ensure that students acquire [[understandings\|understandings]] about the [[great\|great]] [[ideas\|ideas]] of Western civilization." 
 [[ATLAS/Functions & Attitudes/-Te🏹\|-Te🏹]] [[-Fi🔱\|-Fi🔱]] 
>
>"The focus is to teach ideas that are everlasting, to seek enduring truths which are constant, not changing, as the natural and human worlds at their most [[essential\|essential]] level, do not change." [[-Ne 💧\|-Ne 💧]] [[-systematic⚙️\|-systematic⚙️]] [[-result🎯\|-result🎯]]
>
>"The loftiest [[accomplishments\|accomplishments]] of humankind are emphasized– the great works of literature and art, the [[laws\|laws]] or [[ATLAS/Dictionary/Principle\|principles]] of science."

## Essentialism
> "Essentialists believe that there is a common core of knowledge ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fe 💉\|Fe 💉]]) that needs to be transmitted to students in a [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Systematic 🔧\|Systematic 🔧]], [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si 🏔️\|disciplined]] ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]) way."
> "The emphasis in this conservative perspective is on  intellectual and moral [[ATLAS/Dictionary/Standard\|standards]] ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Te 🏹\|Te 🏹]]) that schools should teach"
> "Schooling should be practical, preparing students to become valuable members of society ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fe 💉\|Fe 💉]])."
> "It should focus on facts ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ti 🗡️\|Ti 🗡️]]) -the objective reality ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Se 🌪️\|Se 🌪️]]) out there--and "the basics," training students to read, write, speak, and compute clearly and logically ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ti 🗡️\|Ti 🗡️]])."
> "Students should be taught hard work, [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Reverance\|respect]] for [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Authority\|authority]], and [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si 🏔️\|discipline]]" [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]  [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Mind Temple ⚒️\|Mind Temple ⚒️]] 

## Progressivism
> "Progressivists believe that education should focus on the whole child, rather than on the content or the teacher." [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Soul Temple 👥\|Soul Temple 👥]]
> "This educational philosophy stresses that students should test ideas ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Abstract\|Abstract]]) by active [[ATLAS/Dictionary/Experimentation\|Experimentation]] ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Concrete\|Concrete]])." 
> "Learning is rooted in the questions of learners that arise through experiencing the world ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]). It is active ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Initiating\|extraverted]]), not passive. The learner is a problem solver and thinker ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ti 🗡️\|Ti 🗡️]]) who makes meaning through his or her individual experience in the physical ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]) and cultural ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]) context"
> "Effective teachers provide experiences so that students can learn by doing ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]])"
> "Curriculum content is derived from student [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Interest 🤝\|interests]] and questions."
> "The scientific [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Systematic 🔧\|method]] is used by progressivist educators so that students can study matter and events [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Systematic 🔧\|systematically]] and first hand. The emphasis is on [[process\|process]]- [[ATLAS/Dictionary/The How\|how]] one comes to know."
> "John Dewey was its foremost proponent. One of his tenets was that the school should improve the way of life ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Progression➕\|Progression➕]] [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]) of our citizens through  experiencing freedom ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ni 🔥\|Ni 🔥]] [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]]) and democracy in schools. Shared decision making ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Te 🏹\|Te 🏹]]), planning of teachers with students, student-selected topics are all aspects. Books are tools, rather than authority."

## Reconstructionism / Critical Theory
> "Social reconstructionism is a philosophy that emphasizes the addressing of social questions and a quest to create a better society and worldwide democracy" [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fe 💉\|Fe 💉]]
> "Critical theorists, like social reconstructionists, believe that systems ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Systematic 🔧\|Systematic 🔧]]) must be changed to overcome oppression and improve human conditions."
> "Curriculum focuses on student experience ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si 🏔️\|Si 🏔️]]) and taking social action on real problems ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fe 💉\|Fe 💉]]), such as violence, hunger, international terrorism, inflation, and inequality. Strategies for dealing with controversial issues (particularly in social studies and literature), inquiry, dialogue, and multiple perspectives ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ne 💧\|Ne 💧]]) are the focus. Community-based learning and bringing the world into the classroom ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Se 🌪️\|Se 🌪️]]) are also strategies."

## Ecclecticism 
> "draws upon multiple theories, styles, or ideas to gain complementary insights into a subject, or applies different theories in particular cases" [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ne 💧\|Ne 💧]]

## Existentialism
[[CARDS/Type Practice/IRL Typed/Artists/Ecrivains/Jean Paul Sartre\|Jean Paul Sartre]], [[CARDS/Type Practice/IRL Typed/Artists/Ecrivains/Nietzsche\|Nietzsche]], [[Kierkegaard\|Kierkegaard]]
> "While the famous existentialists would passionately disagree with one another on many basic philosophical issues, what they shared was a respect for individualism." [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]] 
> "In particular, they argued that traditional approaches to philosophy do not adequately respect the unique concerns of each individual." [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]
> "Jean Paul Sartre's classic formulation of existentialism--that "existence precedes essence"-- means that there exists no universal, inborn human nature. We are born and exist, and then we ourselves freely determine our essence (that is, our innermost nature)" [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ni 🔥\|Ni 🔥]]
> "Existentialism rejects the existence of any source of objective, authoritative truth  about metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Instead, individuals are responsible for determining for themselves what is "true" or "false," "right" or "wrong," "beautiful" or "ugly." For the existentialist, there exists no universal form of human nature; each of us has the free will to  develop as we see fit."[[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ni 🔥\|Ni 🔥]]-[[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]
> "In the existentialist classroom, subject matter takes second place to helping the students understand and appreciate themselves as unique individuals who accept complete responsibility for their thoughts, feelings, and actions" [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]], [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Mature 🐢\|maturity]]
> "The teacher's role is to help students define their own essence by exposing them to various paths they may take in life ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ne 💧\|Ne 💧]]) and creating an environment ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Se 🌪️\|Se 🌪️]]) in which they may freely choose their own preferred ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fi 🔱\|Fi 🔱]]) way"
> "Since feeling is not divorced from reason in decision making, the existentialist demands the education of the whole person, not just the mind." [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Soul Temple 👥\|Soul Temple 👥]]
> "the humanities are commonly given tremendous emphasis. They are explored as a means of providing students with vicarious experiences that will help unleash their own creativity and self-expression. For example, rather than emphasizing historical events, existentialists focus upon the actions of historical individuals, each of whom provides possible models for the students' own behavior." [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Se 🌪️\|Se 🌪️]] 
> "In teaching art, existentialism encourages individual creativity and imagination more than copying and imitating established models." [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Abstract\|Abstract]] over [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Concrete\|Concrete]]
> "Learning is self-paced, self directed, and includes a great deal of individual contact with the teacher, who relates to each student openly and honestly." [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]], [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Sincerity\|Sincerity]] of ENTP
