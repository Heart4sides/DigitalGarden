# Memories, Dreams, Reflections
C. Jung, A. Jaffé, 1962
'I can understand myself only in the light of inner happenings. It is these that make up the singularity of my life, and with these my autobiography deals' - Carl Gustav Jung. In 1957, four years before his death, Carl Gustav Jung began writing his life story. But what began as an exercise in autobiography soon morphed into an altogether more profound undertaking. The result is an absorbing piece of self-analysis: a frank statement of faith, philosophy and principles from one of the great explorers of the human mind. Covering everything from Sigmund Freud, analytical psychology and Jungian dream interpretation to a forthright discussion of Christianity and the existence of God, these final reflections on an extraordinary life are a fitting coda to the work of Carl Gustav Jung.

>  “I am [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Satisfaction\|satisfied]] with the course my life has taken. It has beenbountiful, and has given me a great deal. How could I ever have [[CARDS/· Related Concepts & Theories ·/Expectation\|expected]] so much? Nothing but unexpected things kept happening to me. Much might have been different if I myself had been different. 
>  Many things worked out as I planned them to, but that did not always prove of benefit to me. But almost everything developed naturally and by destiny.
>  I regret many follies which sprang from my [[obstinacy\|obstinacy]]; but without that trait I would not have reached my goal. And so I am disappointed and not disappointed. I am disappointed with people and disappointed with myself. I have learned amazing things from people, and have accomplished more than I expected of myself.
>   I cannot form any final judgment because the phenomenon of life and the phenomenon of man are too vast. The older I have become, the less I have understood or had insight into or known about myself.
>   I am astonished, disappointed, pleased with myself. I am distressed, depressed, rapturous. I am all these things at once, and cannot add up the sum. I am incapable of determining ultimate worth or worthlessness; I have no judgment about myself and my life. There is nothing I am quite sure about. I have no definite convictions - not about anything, really. I know only that I was born and exist, and it seems to me that I have been carried along. I exist on the foundation or something I do not know.” ~ CARL JUNG
