**Description**: Aion is one of a number of major works that Jung wrote during his seventies that were concerned with the relations between psychology, alchemy and religion. He is particularly concerned in this volume with the rise of Christianity and with the figure of Christ. He explores how Christianity came about when it did, the importance of the figure of Christ and the identification of the figure of Christ with the archetype of the Self. A matter of special importance to Jung in his seventies - the problem of opposites, particularly good and evil - is further discussed and the importance of the symbolism of the fish, which recurs as a symbol of both Christ and the devil, is examined. As a study of the archetype of the self, Aion complements The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, which is also published in paperback.}[^1]

> ‚ÄúAs we know, it is not the conscious subject but the unconscious which does the projecting. Hence one meets with projections, one does not make them. The effect of projection is to isolate the subject from his environment, since instead of a real relation to it there is now only an illusory one. Projections change the world into the replica of one's own unknown face. In the last analysis, therefore, they lead to an autoerotic or autistic condition in which one dreams a world whose reality remains forever unattainable. The resultant sentiment d'incompletude and the still worse feeling of sterility are in their turn explained by projection as the malevolence of the environment.‚Äù ([[CARDS/Individuals/C.G. Jung\|C.G. Jung]], [1969](https://archive.org/details/collectedworksof92cgju), p27)

> *‚ÄúWhat, then, is this projection-making factor? The East calls it the "Spinning Woman" x ‚ÄîMaya, who creates illusion by her dancing. Had we not long since known it from the symbolism of dreams, this hint from the Orient would put us on the right track: the enveloping, embracing, and devouring element points unmistakably to the mother,2 that is, to the son's relation to the real mother, to her imago, and to the woman who is to become a mother for him. His Eros is passive like a child's; he hopes to be caught, sucked in, enveloped, and devoured. He seeks, as it were, the protecting, nourishing, charmed circle of the mother, the condition of the infant released from every care, in which the outside world bends over him and even forces happiness upon him. No wonder the real world vanishes from sight!‚Äù* ([[CARDS/Individuals/C.G. Jung\|C.G. Jung]], [1969](https://archive.org/details/collectedworksof92cgju), p29)

> ‚Äú**The effect of anima and animus on the ego is in principle the same. This effect is extremely difficult to eliminate because, in the first place, it is uncommonly strong and immediately fills the ego-personality with an unshakable feeling of Tightness and¬† righteousness. In the second place, the cause of the effect is pro- jected and appears to lie in objects and objective situations.**‚Äù ([[CARDS/Individuals/C.G. Jung\|C.G. Jung]], [1969](https://archive.org/details/collectedworksof92cgju), p34)
