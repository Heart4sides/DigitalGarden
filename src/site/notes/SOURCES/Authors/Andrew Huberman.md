# Cannabis Effects
Ref :: [The Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain & Body | Huberman Lab Podcast #92 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48&t=5400)

- Decrease electrical activity in the hippocampus --> impairs short term memory  
- Suppression of neural circuits Basoganglia and : action (go/no go), planning,  
- CB1 receptors are mostly located in : 
	- the hippotalamus : cravings  
	- the spinal cord  
- Most studies don't distinguish between sativa and indica strains  
  
Creativity  
- convergent thinking : common thread, framework of ideas to create a specific outcome  
- divergent thinking (Ne) : brainstorming, novel ideas  
- Dopamine increases divergent thinking  
- Creativity is a process  
- cannabis users are generally more open to novel ideas, less stressed

# Nicotine Effects & how to quit

- Nicotines binds to receptors in the brain.
- Acetylcholine and nicotine play very important roles. 
- Chewing nicotine might enhance focus and motivation 
- [[Mood\|Mood]] enhancer. Mood drops when stop nicotine. 
- In nightshades : tomatoes, eggplants, sweet peppers, potatoes (but much lower than in tabacco)
- Alkaloid : evolved in plants probably as a way to prevent insects from eating them. Can kill or sterilize insects. 
- Heat liberates the nicotine and enables it to go into bloodstreams

- Acetylcholine : changes the way cells (that it binds to) behave 
- Acetylcholine receptors : 
	- Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
	- Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors
-  Main effects of nicotine in the brain are mediated by nicotine binding to the alpha four beta two receptor
- Nicotine increases metabolism and reduces hunger 
- Mesolimbic reward pathway : 
	- The ventral tegmental area (VTA) connects ↔️ to the nucleus accumbens. 
	- Nicotine triggers the release of dopamine from the nucleus accumbens. 
	- That's why nicotine increases ⤴️ motivation. 
	- Also triggers release of chemicals from the VTA which impinge on nucleus accumbens and increase dopamine levels further.  
	- In the Mesolimbic reward circuit, there are accelerators that release more dopamine, and breaks of the [[GABA\|GABA]]ergic variety.  
	- Nicotine decreases ⤵️ the activity of GABA, which removes the brake. 
	- So there's a 2 pronged effet of nicotine o reinforcement reward dopamine related pathways

2 effect : ↗️ [[acetylcholine\|acetylcholine]].
[[acetylcholine\|acetylcholine]] released from nucleus basalis

# Focus 
- Meditation practice of 13 minutes a day increases focus. Close eyes, direct attention inside your forehead. 
- Focus is like an arrow: 
	- The head of the arrow is largely set by [[acetylcholine\|acetylcholine]]. 
	- The shaft is set by a chemical called [[adrenaline\|adrenaline]] / epinephrine, providing the energy. 
	- The propeller is dopamine. It pushes you forwards. 
	- 💊 [[Alpha GPC\|Alpha GPC]] : increases the focus.

# How to learn

 ```

Neuroplasticity process is dependant on 
- dopamine
- Norepinephrine
- [[acetylcholine\|Acetylcholine]] 
In Biology almost anything is a process
Take rest --> learn much faster
From very focused to very relaxed
Everything is a 90 minute cycle
Freedom software to turn off the internet

Learning is supposed to be stressful. 
Take a break every 90 minutes. 
Gap learning effects
Engage - disengage
