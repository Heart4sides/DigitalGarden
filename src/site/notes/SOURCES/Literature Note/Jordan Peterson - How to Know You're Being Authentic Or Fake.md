“now how would you detect your own  inauthenticity or you in your own in  congruence well Rogers had this idea  that he called sub ception which was  maybe something that you might regard as  a sixth sense it's sort of like proprio  centric perception and that's the perception that you have of your body as  its reacting and localized in time and  space ([[CARDS/Typing Toolbox/-Si⛰️\|-Si⛰️]]) and so it's sort of like touch the  feeling but it's it's it's your sense of  how you're reacting internally and where  you are a lot of that is observed by the  autonomic nervous system which is  reporting to you about various states of  being in your body Rogers believed that  you could use the information that's  being provided to you from your body  sort of bought them up to determine when  you were being inauthentic or no  incongruent and I've thought about this  for a long time and tried to sort it out  in a practical manner and what I've  concluded is this you could try this for  a couple of weeks it's an extremely  interesting exercise so you sort of have  to detach yourself from your thoughts  and your and and what you say so you got  to assume you start by assuming that  what you say in what you think is not  necessarily you (**Already doing that with [[CARDS/Typing Toolbox/-Te🏹\|-Te🏹]]**) and of course that's  just the case because a lot of what you  think in fact most of what you think and  most of what you say are the opinions of  other people there are things you've  read or things people have told you and  you know that that's a benefit in some  ways because you get all those thoughts  that other people have spent a long time  formulating but it's a disadvantage in  that it's not exactly you okay so you  detach yourself from that you're no  longer your thoughts or or or the things  that you say or maybe you're no longer  all of them and now what you're gonna  try to find out is which of your  thoughts and things that you say are you  and maybe so you cannot utilize the rest  or maybe so that you can correct the  rest because they're not representative  of yourself as a as an integrated being  they don't take everything into account  my sense has been that you can tell when  you're saying something that's not  authentic by feeling out whether or not  it makes you weak or strong ([[CARDS/Typing Toolbox/-Fi🧭\|-Fi🧭]] / [[CARDS/Typing Toolbox/-Si⛰️\|-Si⛰️]]) now you know  sometimes when you're conversing with  people you can say something that  embarrasses yourself now Nietzsche said  for example everyone has perjured  themselves at least once in the attempt  to maintain their good name something  like that it's not an exact quote but  I've got the gist of it right so maybe  you're saying things to impress someone  or you're saying things to remain part  of your political group or your social  group or whatever or maybe you have  attributes personal attributes that  might be positive that you're ashamed of  and so you're not going to speak about  them  so there's a falseness about your self  representation watch for two weeks and  see make a rule that if you start to say  something and it makes you feel weak  it's hard to describe exactly what that  means to to me what it means is that I  can feel things coming apart sort of in  my midsection so I think it's an  autonomic phenomena and the the  subjective sense is of a falsehood it's  like I've just stepped off the solid  ground and onto something that it  doesn't support me well and it it feels  like a self betrayal so that's  existential inauthenticity you can feel  it right away and then the rule is shut  up  if that happens stop talking and then  feel around and see if you can find some  words that you can say in that situation  that don't produce that sensation and  it's like you see this played out in  different forms of drama so there's  there's a scene in The Lord of the Rings  for example where I believe it's Gollum  and Bilbo say it's the Lord of the Rings  it's yeah it's Bilbo it's Lord of the  Rings not The Hobbit because the hobbits  Frodo right so it's Bilbo there I forgot  it wrong it's the other way around  okay so Gollum and Frodo yes are going  across this swamp and the swamp is full  of essentially full of dead souls and  they have to step very carefully in  order to not fall off the track and the  stones are sort of hidden underneath  surface and the implication there is  that in order to follow a trail properly  you have to pick your your ground very  carefully and you have to test it to see  if it's solid or you'll slip off into  this well essentially what it is is  chaos you'll slip off into chaos and  that's a dramatic representation of what  I'm what I'm suggesting to you it's like  all you have to do is notice but and you  have to pay attention and so to some  degree what you're doing in fact is  you're making your capacity to pay  attention super ordinate to your  capacity to think and to speak because  you know you might ask yourself well  exactly what are you well I said you can  identify yourself with your intellect  and that's very very common it's sort of  like the worst sin of intelligent people  but that isn't all you are and there are  lots of reasons for making the  assumption that attention is a higher  order function than intellect because  attention is what teaches intellect so  if by if you pay very very careful  attention to what you say without having  the automatic without bringing the  automatic assumption that what you say  is you to bear on the conversation and  then also to feel like you have to  defend it once you say it you'll find  very rapidly that very much of what you  think and say has absolutely nothing to  do with you it's just it's the dead  souls that are in that little scene that  I described to you sort of manifesting  themselves in your head they're dead  ideas that other people have created and  some of them might be applicable to you  you know you might have the right to  them so to speak but lots of them won't  and you're using the words as camouflage  or self-defense or as an attempt to  attain status in the status hierarchy or  can make yourself look smarter than you  are or there's all sorts of reasons or  to hide what you think from other people  I see this in undergraduate essays all  the time so because the essays are full  of cliches and you know it's not all  that obvious why a cliche is a bad thing  but a cliche is a bad thing in the same  way that being possessed by the dead is  a bad thing it's like a cliche isn't you  it's something else it's like the crowd  it's like the other it's it's not living  it has nothing to do with you and part  of the  that students use cliches is because  it's easier than than using your own  genuine creative formulation so you can  just default to cliche use but there's  something more insidious than that is  that if you write an essay that's  nothing but a string of cliches and you  get criticized then you're not being  criticized what's being criticized is  the cliches and you can hide behind that  and the part of you that's wise but but  but treacherous thinks well the  criticism doesn't really apply to me  because you know I didn't really say  what I thought and then there's this  kind of sense you get that you've gotten  away with something which is a terrible  thing  so when I read undergraduate essays what  I see very frequently is especially the  first essay it's just nothing but  cliches it's awful it's it's dull you  can hardly stand reading it because  there's nothing in it that's gripping or  alive and then maybe the second essay  you can see there's a layer of cliche  and then now and then the person will be  brave enough to poke up a thought of  their own it'll just sort of poke up  somewhere maybe in three pages in it's  like this little green chute that's  barely alive and the person is brave  enough to pop it up in the hope that you  know maybe it won't get walloped down  with a sledge hammer and so one of the  things I try to do is to point that out  it's like look you know this is  something there's a real thought here  it's a real original thought it's  something that you have the right to  because it's derived from your own  experience ([[CARDS/Typing Toolbox/-Si⛰️\|-Si⛰️]]) and your own knowledge ([[CARDS/Typing Toolbox/-Ti🗡️\|-Ti🗡️]] ) and  you've formulated it in an original and  compelling way but the problem with that  is that if you get criticized for that  you're just gonna pull right back into  your shell right because that hurts  because it's actually part of you that  you've exposed and that's a terrifying  thing to expose yourself like that but  it's it's it's an absolute prerequisite  to genuine communication and thought”
