# Description
This episode is all about the two major kinds of dreams and the sorts of learning and unlearning they are used for. I discuss REM-associated dreams that control emotional learning and their similarity to various trauma treatments such as ketamine and EMDR. I also discuss Non-REM dreams and their role in motor learning and learning of detailed, non-emotionally-laden information. I relate this to science-backed tools for accessing more of the types of sleep and learning people may want. Other topics are listed in the time stamps below. Please put any questions or thoughts (or dreams!) you have in the comments section.

# Quotes & Notes

shallow sleep = slow waves sleep = early in the night 
the more we sleep, the more REM sleep you get in your 90min cycle 

## Slow Wave Sleep (~5:00)
- Brain metabolically active 
- High [[Serotonin\|Serotonin]] : bliss, wanting to remain still 
- Almost no [[SOURCES/Contents/Acetylcholine\|Acetylcholine]] (= no focus)
- High [[Norepinephrine\|Norepinephrine]]
- Sleep walking 
- Motor skill learning
- Learn detailed information 

## REM Sleep (~15:00) 
- No [[Serotonin\|Serotonin]]  
- No [[Norepinephrine\|Norepinephrine]]
- Paralyzed (Atonia) 
- Hallucinatory activity 
- Dream Drugstore ( [J. Allan Hobson](https://www.amazon.co.uk/J-Allan-Hobson/e/B001IZX88C/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1))
- No Epinephrine 
	- Desire to move, alertness 
	- Chemical signature of fear, panic and anxiety (equivalent to adrenaline) 
	- Allows us to experience things in the absence of fear and anxiety 
- unlearning of emotional events 
- If you don’t get enough REM sleep 
	- emotionally irritiable. Little things become big things. 
	- Creation of weird associations, things look distorted 
- Replay of detailed spacial information, where we were
- Forming relationship with particular rules or algorithm 
	- Approach or avoid places, people, etc 
	- Creation of meaning. Discard irrelevant meaning. 
- EMDR  
	- very similar to REM sleep 
	- move eyes right-left 
	- supress the activity of the amygdala (stress detection, fear) 
	- You don’t forget the traumatic experience but you remove the emotional potency 
	- most effective for single events (like car crash) 
- Ketamine 
	- very similar to REM sleep 
	- Dissociative anesthetic 
	- Like PCP 
		- Blocks / Disrupt the activity of the NMDA receptor : on surface of neurons, not active until sth extreme happens then it opens to allow the entry of molecule that trigger the long term potentiation –> change in connectivity to attach it to the event  
	- Ketamine prevents learning of emotions very soon after trauma 
- ~50:00 Menopause change of temperature affects sleep 

## Other topics 
51:00 How to get enough sleep ? 
- For learning : regularity in the duration is more important than duration 
- Don’t drink too much fluid. Having to urinate = anxious experience. 
	- You’ll recall more of your dreams because you’re getting in and out of sleep 

- 57:30 In REM : 
	- Shift in neurotransmittor : less [[Serotonin\|Serotonin]] 

Increase % of SWS 
- resistance exercise –> release of growth hormone happening early in the night 

1:00:00 Remember your dreams : 
- Write down : “I want to remember the red apple”

Have less lucid dream : wake up at the end of a 1h30 cycle 

Alcohol & Marijuana : 
- pseudo sleep like. 

1:04:00 Theory of Mind : 
- looks like [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Initiating👋\|extraverted]] [[CARDS/Depth Psychology Theory/Cognitive Functions\|functions]] 
- some autistic children can’t use theory of mind (Se trickster ?)
- Show up most in REM associated dreams 

Neuroplasticity = ability to change itself in response to [[Experience\|Experience]] nce
