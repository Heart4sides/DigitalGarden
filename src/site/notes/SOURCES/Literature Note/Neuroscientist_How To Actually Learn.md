[NEUROSCIENTIST: How To ACTUALLY LEARN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW0iNSrmcDQ) 
    

# Description
Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman explains how everybody can learn much faster using "Gap Effects" and other learning techniques. Andrew Huberman reveals truth about studying and gives out best tips and tricks for quicker studying. We all have to learn throughout our lives, so we can improve and become better and more knowledgeable. A lot of people are studying in wrong way, which decreases their results by a huge margin. You don't have to ask how to study better or learn faster anymore! Well-known neuroscientist Andrew Huberman has revealed the best study tips for everybody, and some of them might shock you! Andrew Huberman is an American neuroscientist and associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine who has made many contributions to the brain development, brain plasticity, and neural regeneration and repair fields.
