## Perennialism
[[ATLAS/Typology MOC/3. Philosopher\|Philosopher]] temperament 
> "For Perennialists, the aim of education is to ensure that students acquire understandings ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Te\|Te]]) about the great ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fi\|Fi]]) ideas ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ne\|Ne]]) of Western civilization."
> "The focus is to teach ideas that are everlasting, to seek enduring truths which are constant, not changing, as the natural and human worlds at their most essential level, do not change." [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ne\|Ne]] 
> "The loftiest accomplishments ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Te\|Te]]) of humankind are emphasized– the great works of literature and art, the laws ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Te\|Te]]) or [[ATLAS/Dictionary/Principle\|principles]] ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fi\|Fi]]) of science."

## Essentialism
> "Essentialists believe that there is a common core of knowledge ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fe\|Fe]]) that needs to be transmitted to students in a [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Systematic\|systematic]], [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si\|disciplined]] ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si\|Si]]) way."
> "The emphasis in this conservative perspective is on  intellectual and moral [[ATLAS/Dictionary/Standard\|standards]] ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Te\|Te]]) that schools should teach"
> "Schooling should be practical, preparing students to become valuable members of society ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fe\|Fe]])."
> "It should focus on facts ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ti\|Ti]]) -the objective reality ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Se\|Se]]) out there--and "the basics," training students to read, write, speak, and compute clearly and logically ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ti\|Ti]])."
> "Students should be taught hard work, [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Reverance\|respect]] for [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Authority\|authority]], and [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si\|discipline]]" [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si\|Si]]  [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Mind Temple ⚒️\|Mind Temple ⚒️]] 

## Progressivism
> "Progressivists believe that education should focus on the whole child, rather than on the content or the teacher." [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Soul Temple 👥\|Soul Temple 👥]]
> "This educational philosophy stresses that students should test ideas ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Abstract\|Abstract]]) by active [[ATLAS/Dictionary/Experimentation\|Experimentation]] ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Concrete\|Concrete]])." 
> "Learning is rooted in the questions of learners that arise through experiencing the world ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si\|Si]]). It is active ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Initiating\|extraverted]]), not passive. The learner is a problem solver and thinker ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ti\|Ti]]) who makes meaning through his or her individual experience in the physical ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si\|Si]]) and cultural ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fi\|Fi]]) context"
> "Effective teachers provide experiences so that students can learn by doing ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Si\|Si]])"
> "Curriculum content is derived from student [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Interest\|interests]] and questions."
> "The scientific [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Systematic\|method]] is used by progressivist educators so that students can study matter and events [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Systematic\|systematically]] and first hand. The emphasis is on [[process\|process]]- [[ATLAS/Dictionary/The How\|how]] one comes to know."
> "John Dewey was its foremost proponent. One of his tenets was that the school should improve the way of life ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Movement\|Movement]] [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fi\|Fi]]) of our citizens through  experiencing freedom ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ni\|Ni]] [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Pragmatic\|Pragmatic]]) and democracy in schools. Shared decision making ([[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Te\|Te]]), planning of teachers with students, student-selected topics are all aspects. Books are tools, rather than authority."

## Reconstructionism / Critical Theory
> "Social reconstructionism is a philosophy that emphasizes the addressing of social questions and a quest to create a better society and worldwide democracy" [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Fe\|Fe]]
> "Critical theorists, like social reconstructionists, believe that systems must be changed to  overcome oppression and improve human conditions."
