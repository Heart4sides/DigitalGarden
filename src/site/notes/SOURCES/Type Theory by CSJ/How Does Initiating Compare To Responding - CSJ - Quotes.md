"I say [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Initiating\|Extraversion]] because his point  was is that people need something a  little bit extra right and the extra  thing that they need is other human  beings being around them interacting  with fellow human beings preferably in a  group setting so they can get in their  mind can gain the mental energy that  they need in order to stay productive  and order for them to continue to  continue on what they're doing for them  not to be depressed for example"
"Three's a crowd two is a tango"
"you're not afraid or not concerned  about it you're just are you're not  gonna rely on science it's more useful  to you to just go up to somebody and ask  them for directions right if we're gonna  be using the example for directions an  introvert sometimes they're there  they're in a place they've never been  before it would be more useful to them  if there was like you know signs and  they're hoping secretly inside of  themself oh I sure hope there's a sign  that tells me where I can go so I don't  have to initiate with somebody"
"[[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Se 🌪️\|Se 🌪️]] users  they don't like feeling left out"
"they would generally  expect that their teammates would keep  them informed and they would get mad if  their teammates started making decisions  without involving them because they've  taken the INTJs opportunity to respond  away and they feel very disrespected by  that and that is a problem right because  it's like whoa why did you all make this  decision without me or you're like so  disrespecting me right now I'm obviously  not important here you know what I mean  but if he was an ENTJ it wouldn't matter  he'd just be like hey what do you what  decisions are you making like constantly  making sure that the ENTJ is in the loop  instead of hoping or expecting other  people to loop them in"
