>    "as it's saving the world the Hero 🦸‍♂️ produces collateral  damage"
"the [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Parent 🤰\|Parent]] is - trying to  impart some of its responsibilities and  confer some of its responsibilities upon  the hero so the person using their hero  becomes more responsible while using it
if you're  being pushed in your insecurities you  can get super defensive negative and  you're pushing your subconscious not at  will and it becomes a very negative  experience for you and everyone around"
"if I can get over my worry I  can access my unconscious mind at will  without a problem or if someone forces  me to try to want something it puts me  into my unconscious side of my mind  against my will and it becomes a  negative experience for me and everyone  else just like with the subconscious"
"the [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/INFJ\|INFJ]] and  the [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/ISFJ\|isfj]] they're constantly trying to  overcompensate by being caring for  others because deep down they feel like  they're trash they feel like they're not  worth it they feel like they don't  deserve good things no life because  they're so critical towards their  self-worth"
"the [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Superego 👹👼\|Superego 👹👼]] does have some positive  components to it what happens if you  burn down the entire forest well new  life grows so there is some use to the  super-ego a little bit of positivity for  light so like 95% negative to five  percent positive"
