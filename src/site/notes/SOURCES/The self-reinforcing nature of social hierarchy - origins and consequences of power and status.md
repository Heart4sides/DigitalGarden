For example, ==conscientiousness predicts hierarchical rank better than extraversion in task-oriented organizations like an engineering firm, but extraversion predicts rank in more socially-oriented organizations, such as a consulting firm (Anderson, Spataro, & Flynn, in press). Similarly, in groups that require little coordination amongst their members, individuals with assertive speaking styles are conferred more status than individuals with tentative speaking styles, but the opposite is true for high coordination groups (Fragale, 2006).== Extraversion is the basis for d*

>*dividuals both impose and face. ==Social psychological studies on obedience to authority and conformity (Guinote et al., 2002; Hollander, 1958; Jetten, Hornsey, & Adarves-Yorno, 2006; Milgram, 1974; Zimbardo, Haney, Banks, & Jaffe, 1975) set the stage for how different positions in social hierarchies create different situational pressures on behavior. People in positions of power are able to set agendas, norms for discussion, rules for behavior, and standards for thought and opinion, all of which constrain the psychological freedom experienced by individuals lower in the hierarchy. Low-power individuals obey the explicit demands of high-power individuals (Milgram, 1974) and are also easily influenced by their more subtle attempts at persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). The world of those who have little power is filled with real and psychological shackles whereas possessing power is often equated with freedom (Hollander, 1958).== One of the best ways to demons*

For example, high-power individuals are also more likely than those without power to openly express their opinions during a group discussion (Anderson & Berdahl, 2002; Berdahl & Martorana, 2006).== In contrast, low-power individu*

These research findings were all motivated by one influential theory, the Power-Approach Theory (Keltner et al., 2003), which claims that possessing power increases the tendency to focus on and approach attractive aspects of situations. This theory is based on two features of power dynamics. First, elevated power is associated with increased access to rewards. Second, power-holders encounter less interference from others when pursuing those rewards.== For complementary  reasons, low*
