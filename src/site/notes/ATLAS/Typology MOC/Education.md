## Introverted Thinking

Ti users learn by themselves. They internalize the inputs to create new knowledge with a deductive process : if this, then that.

They are subject to:

-   Preferred input : Choosing their entrant based on what maintains their comfort or freedom of choice. Come to their conclusion first, then look only for external evidence of their correctness.
    
-   Relying on the last input : once they think they have found the truth, they are likely not to update their thinking by looking for more recent data
    
-   Echo chamber: tend to dismiss people who disagree with them as stupid. So that their reasoning is reinforced by those around them selected according to their agreement with them.
    

They respect the opinions of others by using their Fe, when:

-   They have the humility to know that the only thing they really know is that they know nothing
    
-   They perceive that people are attached to their beliefs and that invalidating those beliefs hurts them
    
-   So they will only correct what they can deductively prove
    
-   It is by listening to the opinions of others that they can gather new input to perfect their thinking

## Temple Integration 

Integration of the [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Body Temple\|Body Temple]]

When education is disconnected from the physical creation, it loses its connection with its usefulness, its reason for being. Knowledge is knowledge only if it can be applied in a concrete way and if its application lasts over time.

Integration of the [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Heart Temple\|Heart Temple]]

No learning without motivation to learn. Passion is by far the most powerful engine of continuous learning.

Integration of the [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Soul Temple\|Soul Temple]] 

A good education must allow the student to discover who he is and allow him to build moral integrity. Standardization of education destroys the individual by stifling rather than protecting his personal voice. The teacher must remember that he or she is teaching humans, not machines.**
