[[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Mature 🐢\|Mature 🐢]]
Figure out the right people to listen to, which opinions are valuable. appearances are deceiving to Te trickster because of the fake social proof (Fe) like credentials and training. break the rules so others can be free and i can finally be socially accepted as myself.

Enforces norms based on beliefs (Te trickster) that they didn't verify. Most cultish types.
"If I didn't solve my own problems before, I won't be able to solve them now." Feels bad because he's not accepted even though he solved everyone's problems. So focused on loving everybody else that they neglect to solve their own problems.

| Finding out what other people value allows me to be more responsible with rules.             | Create rules that are lacking principles because of Fe trickster "anything can be acceptable", and then it causes others to become more ignorant. |
| Accepts that all rules are subjective and allows people to break them for their sake.              | Rely on other's thinking so they aren't seen as bad people.                                                                                       |
| People come first before your rules.              | Insane belief in themselves leads them to lack of verification and failure.                                                                       |
| Do no harm. If your rules are harming somebody you're doing it wrong. Cf Hyppocratic oath.              | The mask is more important than knowing the answer.                                                                                               |
|               | Orbit other people because they don't understand how relationships work.                                                                          |

Only help people to get credibility, which is a covert contract.

Learn to take all of the harm onto itself. Learn how to become the pariah and thus lead by example. All that with self-respect so you don't sacrifice yourself for others. The only way to break their conditioning is if you break your conditioning first. Established social norms may not be healthy. Slay these norms with Ti parent and take the fallout (pariah) for the benefit of others. I break the rules or the chains so that people can be free and I can finally be accepted as myself. Who cares if your feelings are accurate / valid / right / justified ? Be honest about what you feel, which invites criticism from the other party.

An eye for an eye leaved the whole world blind - and no one lives more by the "an eye for an eye" rule than Ti parent.
Fi trickster if it doesn't articulate its feelings they bottle up and create Si bitterness which expresses itself first covertly and then lashes out / or Ni hopelessness. Ti teenager spends so much time thinking about how they can behave so their behaviour can be morally valid and acceptable.
