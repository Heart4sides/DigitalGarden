> "Assumption: If a complete being has all four sides integrated, then there are no extraverted and introverted functions. Only NSTF, where the perception/judgment is able to flow between all of them freely. The ego is a byproduct of splitting the NSTF into extraverted and introverted variants and adding polarity. Combining those two creates the superego. 
> The ego and superego are on an axis themselves, since giving energy to one automatically takes energy away from the other. You have to reverse the polarity and introversion/extraversion. Similar to how Raka explained the function axis in his Cognitive Growth Tracking video. You have to separate this idea from the individual functions themselves, since temples are describing the 4 sides as a whole. If you consider the individual functions, yes the ego functions are in [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Reflection\|reflection]] with the superego functions, but as stated above, the [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ego 🙋‍♂️\|Ego 🙋‍♂️]] and [[SOURCES/Type Theory by CSJ/4 sides/Superego by CSJ\|Superego by CSJ]] have an [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/🧲 Axis\|🧲 Axis]] relationship as whole sides. So that is why, even though [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Soul Temple 👥\|soul]] (Fi-Ne) and [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Body Temple 🌳\|body]] (Te-Si) are on an axis in input process output feedback, body is still kept in the superego since the whole ego side of the mind is soul, the whole superego side of the mind is body, and the ego and superego are on an axis. Even though individual ego functions [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Reflection\|reflect]] superego functions."
