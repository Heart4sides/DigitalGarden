Welcome to the Four Gardens of Mine.

In these [[4 sides of the Mind\|Gardens]] I shall grow plants of a special kind. Alas we will never have the chance to contemplate them with our bodily eyes, and will merely be able to speculate on their fruits, for they exist only in our minds, but in ALL minds, and thus shape the [[ATLAS/Mechanics\|mechanisms]] of interaction of man to man and man to self.  

The base number of these theoretical gardens is 4. 

Until wholeness is found the Self will be spread accross 4 Gardens, and our lives will be spent trying to find how to grow those gardens to their full potential. Each garden will have its own character, desire, mind and purpose, and each will fight to fulfill them if needed. 

One garden shall be favoured by our conscious mind to be the champion of the Self, and this [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Ego\|High Garden]] shall be properous and mighty. But ease and power grow pride, vanity and irresponsibility, and thus the champion one day shall fall and recognize the quality and purpose of the 3 Gardens below him. 

One garden shall grow underground to enable the very existence of the champion, for there can be no hero without a villain. The [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Shadow\|Underground Garden]] shall challenge the champion with evil deeds to keep him sharp and vigilant. It holds the keys to everything the champion lacks in his one-sidedness, and thus it is the keeper of wisdom. If the undergrounds are not being cultivated, the high garden will freeze into smug satisfaction and grow too weak to protect the inferior garden. 

The [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Subconscious\|Inferior Garden]] is filled with vulnerable plants, ignorant plants too paralized by fear to grow. They had faith that the champion will protect them, but when it grew prideful and ignorant himself, the inferior garden was left unprotected. If it aspired to be brave instead of fearful, this garden could grow miracles of happiness. But too consumed by its insecurities, it would rather call for the help of the last garden, the mightiest of all 4, the Abyssal Garden. 

The [[ATLAS/Typology MOC/Superego\|Abyssal Garden]] is trapped far underneath the ground, even deeper than the underground garden which serves as his messenger. Because the Abyssal Garden has been trapped there by the Champion, it holds hateful grudges against him, and waits only for the moment the Champion will fail to burst out of its imprisonment and save his frail godson, the Inferior Garden. But it will do so in the most destructive, evil way, for the abyssal garden is the source of sin nature, the source of chaos which holds the mightiest but most costly power. This shall be the most difficult garden to cultivate, for one shall be tempted to leave it to rot in the deep or to rather access its power in the quickest way, yet it shall demand to be grown with dedication as much as the others, if one desires the fulfillment to which the Abyss hold the final key. 

I shall observe, discuss and experiment the various strategies and techniques of irrigation in an attempt to find the wisest ways to grow the 4 gardens to become 1 prosperous land through harmonious cooperation. 

Most seeds for thoughts you'll see, I have gathered in [C.S. Joseph's](https://csjoseph.life/) vast water garden. A garden I had the opportunity to navigate for the past 2 years, for which I am forever grateful. His own seeds came from experienced gardeners among which Carl Jung, John Beebe, David Kersey, Linda Berens and Dario Nardi, who dedicated their lives to understanding the nature of human seeds in an attempt to explore the paths to human growth. 

I shall observe various plants in their various states of growth as well as those whose growth have come to an end and exist now in a fossilized state. 

I shall invite my hosts to explore the garden at their own likings and gather the seeds which will help them grow in their own garden in their own unique way. 

I shall listen to and be grateful for their appreciations, criticisms, warning and observations.
